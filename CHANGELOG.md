# Changelog

All notable changes to sem are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **ABAP language support.** Classes, class implementations, interfaces, methods and function modules are extracted as entities from `.abap` files (the files abapGit writes) via the mkoval1/tree-sitter-abap grammar, behind a `lang-abap` feature included in `grammar-all`. Methods nest under their class. abapGit's `*.testclasses.abap` files count as test files, and a class declared `FOR TESTING` is a test entity in any file.

- **abapGit file names are read, and abapGit metadata is skipped by default.** `parse_abapgit_name` turns `zcl_foo.clas.testclasses.abap` into object `zcl_foo`, type `clas`, part `testclasses` (`#ns#` becomes `/ns/`), for attaching local and test classes to their global class. Repo-wide scans now skip `.abapgit.xml`, `package.devc.xml` and `<name>.<type>.xml` for the four-letter abapGit object types, so `pom.xml` and other XML are still scanned. `--no-default-excludes` brings them back.

- **ABAP comments and strings no longer count as references.** A name in a `*` column-1 comment, a `"` trailing comment, a `'...'` or backtick literal, or the literal part of a `|...|` template is not a call; names inside a template's `{ ... }` expressions still are. Line numbers and byte offsets are preserved, and no other language's scan changes.

- **ABAP reports, forms, dynpro modules, macros and class-level types and data are entities.** `REPORT zfoo.` and `PROGRAM zfoo.` are a `report`, `FORM ... ENDFORM.` a `form`, `MODULE ... ENDMODULE.` a `module`, and `DEFINE ... END-OF-DEFINITION.` a `macro` (nested under the form it is defined in, if any). A class definition's `TYPES` are `type` entities and its `DATA` `variable` entities, both nested under the class; `DATA` in a program or a body stays out, like other languages' locals. The grammar has no node for `PROGRAM`, `FORM`, `MODULE`, `DEFINE` or `TYPES` and often folds `ENDFORM` into an error node, so these are read off the token stream by a separate, removable pass, and carry `source: abap-fallback` in their metadata. Local classes in `zcl_foo.clas.locals_imp.abap` and `.locals_def.abap` and test classes in `.testclasses.abap` get `zcl_foo`'s class as parent, from the file name alone. Interface methods keep their full name, `zif_foo~run` instead of `zif_foo`. `form`, `macro` and `report` are known to qualified names (`sem find "form do_it"`) and history hotspots.

- **ABAP names are case-insensitive.** `sem find ZCL_FOO`, `sem find zcl_foo` and `sem find Zcl_Foo` return the same entities, named as written in source, and a reference written in one case resolves to a definition written in another. Only ABAP folds names, and only ASCII; every other language's output is unchanged. The index files ABAP names under their lowercased form, so an index written before this change keeps answering exact spellings until it is rebuilt.

- **`sem find --in <path> --parse-report` lists each file's entity and parse-error counts.** One row per file, with `--json` an array of `{file, entity_count, grammar_entity_count, fallback_entity_count, error_node_count}`: how many entities the file yielded, how many of those the grammar gave and how many a fallback pass read off the tokens (ABAP's `form`, `module`, `macro`, `report` and class `type`), and how many tree-sitter `ERROR` and `MISSING` nodes its parse tree has. A file with no entities is listed with zeros, and one with error nodes and no entities is also named on stderr, so a parse failure is never mistaken for an empty file. Without `--json` the rows are followed by the totals. It always parses, never answering from the index, and any other `sem find` output is unchanged. On a real repository, `sem find --in src --parse-report --json --file-exts .abap` is the parse-error census in one command.

- **ABAP references reach other files.** ABAP has no imports, so a name used to resolve only inside its own file and no ABAP edge crossed a file. A global class or interface, a function module and a report are now candidates repo-wide, as global names are unique per system; a local class, form, module or macro is a candidate only inside its own object (the other files of the same class or function group); and a method or attribute of a global class is a candidate repo-wide when no other global class defines the name, and otherwise only inside its object. `zif_foo~run` is looked up as one name, though the tokenizer splits it at the `~`. On abap2xlsx, `sem find add_new_worksheet --callers` now lists `zcl_excel_reader_2007.load_workbook` as a caller instead of a possible one; on abapGit the graph goes from 8717 to 29641 edges, 18822 of them between objects, and seven of the ten where-used benchmark methods get from 6 to 26 resolved callers, where they had 0 or 1 (the other three are two interface methods, called through a reference, and a name two classes define). The visibility is read off the abapGit file name (`abap_name::abap_global_scope`), and the lookup is a stopgap until calls bind by receiver type. A unique name that is also an ABAP keyword (`create`, `get`, `read`) binds only where the entity writes it as a call or a component (`create(`, `->create`, `=>create`), so `CREATE PUBLIC` in a class definition no longer reaches the repo's one method `create`. Only ABAP files read the new table, and every other language's output is unchanged.

- **ABAP calls in a static form resolve exactly.** ABAP joins the call-graph pipeline that Python, Go and Rust use, so a call that names its target without a receiver type now binds to that definition and nothing else: `me->m( )` and a bare `m( )` to the class's own method (or the one it inherits), `zcl_foo=>m( )` in any case to `zcl_foo`'s, `super->m( )` to the base class's, `zif_foo~m( )` to the class's implementation, `CALL METHOD x->m` as `x->m( )`, `CALL FUNCTION 'Z_FM'` to the function module the literal names, `PERFORM f` to the form in the same program or function group, and `NEW zcl_foo( )` to the class. A call through a variable, a parameter or an attribute has no receiver type yet and is reported as unresolved (`unknown receiver type` under `SEM_CALLS_STATS`) rather than guessed. Until receivers are typed, the name-based resolver still runs beside the pipeline and keeps its edges, so no ABAP edge is lost; where both find a pair, the pipeline's kind wins. On abapGit the pipeline adds 1976 edges, 1906 of them ABAP calls, and the program's own statements are now the body of its `report`, so a report's `PERFORM` and `CALL FUNCTION` have a caller. Every other language's output is unchanged.

- **ABAP callers keep what the graph cannot bind, and say why.** The "possible callers" of `sem find --callers`, `callers`, `impact` and `certify` come from a text scan, which treated an `.abap` file as all code, matched names case-sensitively and took `lo->m( )` for a bare call. For ABAP it now scans the stripped text (the one stripper, `strip_abap_content`, now public) and folds case, so a `'ZFX_FM'` literal names `zfx_fm`; `->` and `=>` calls are member calls ("call through an untyped reference"), `zif~m( )` is a call through an interface, `CALL METHOD x->m`, `CALL FUNCTION 'X'` and `PERFORM f` count as calls, and a `METHODS m` or `FORM f` declaration is a definition and not a caller. A computed call (`CALL FUNCTION lv_fm`, `CALL METHOD zcl_x=>(lv_meth)`, `PERFORM (lv_form)`) adds a `dynamic_call` reason to a function module, a method of that class or a form it can reach, naming the first site, with a static class listed as a possible caller; computed calls it cannot attribute (an untyped receiver, `CREATE OBJECT ... TYPE (lv)`) are counted in `checked`. A name defined in two classes says so on its call reasons. The text search behind the scan (`files_containing`, and `certify`'s) folds case for ABAP. Output for every other language is unchanged.
- **An ABAP program and its includes are one scope, and a function group's global data is an entity.** `INCLUDE zfoo_f01.` pastes that file's forms into the including program, so a `PERFORM` there reaches a form that lives in another abapGit file. A form, module or macro is now visible in its compiled unit: its own object, plus every object an `INCLUDE` joins it to, in either direction, so an include sees the main program and its sibling includes. Two programs that include nothing in common keep their forms apart. The includes are read off the statements like `FORM`, so a comment or a literal that says `INCLUDE` is not one, and `INCLUDE STRUCTURE x.`, `INCLUDE TYPE x.` and `INCLUDE <icon>.` link nothing. An include resolves through abapGit naming, to `<name>.prog.abap` or a function group's own `<group>.fugr.<name>.abap`, and one that names no file of the repo (abapGit does not serialise the generated `uxx` include) is recorded with the reason `include not in repo` instead of being dropped. An include shared by two programs merges both into one unit, so each sees the other's forms; the number of those is counted (`IncludeGraph::shared`). A function group's `TOP` include (`l<group>top`, or a program named `*top`) now gives its top-level `DATA` as `variable` entities, so a form's use of `gv_extra` is a `typeref` edge to the declaration; `DATA` in any other program stays out. A new `INCLUDE` in a file re-resolves the readers in the unit it joins, in a cached-graph rebuild and in the incremental session. On abapGit, abap2xlsx and open-abap-core the graph is unchanged: three of abapGit's eight `INCLUDE` statements resolve (the five others are user exits and a `uxx`), abap2xlsx has none, and open-abap-core's four function-group mains include only their own parts. `PERFORM f IN PROGRAM x` still waits for the call resolver.

### Changed

- **An ABAP class is one entity.** `CLASS x DEFINITION` and `CLASS x IMPLEMENTATION` used to be a `class` and an `impl` with the same name; they are now one `class` that spans both blocks and owns the definition's `DATA` and `TYPES` and the implementation's methods, so `sem find zcl_foo` returns one entity. Its metadata gives each block's lines as `range.definition` and `range.implementation`. Its content blanks the text between the two blocks, and its hashes combine the two blocks' own, so neither that text nor the blocks' order changes them. `sem diff` reports a method body edit as the method and a definition edit as the class. An implementation with no definition in the file, as in `.locals_imp.abap`, is a `class` on its own. Methods of a `FOR TESTING` class are tests in any file, not only in `.testclasses.abap`.

- **The ABAP grammar is vendored as sem's own fork.** sem used to build against the `tree-sitter-abap-sqry` crate; it now builds against `crates/tree-sitter-abap`, a copy of mkoval1/tree-sitter-abap at `c7604df` (MIT) with its `grammar.js`, so grammar fixes can land in this repository. The parser is regenerated from `grammar.js` with tree-sitter CLI 0.26.8 and gives the same tree as before on every `.abap` file in abapGit. The crate's `README.md` lists the fork's changes and how to regenerate and test it.

- **Telemetry is off by default in this fork.** A fresh install used to count command names locally (mode `local`, never uploaded); it now records nothing until `sem config telemetry local` or `on` is run. A mode already stored in `~/.sem/telemetry.json` is respected.

- **Windows CI runs the test suite against release builds and reports every failure.** The wall-time and scale tests are calibrated for optimized binaries, so the debug build on the Windows runner overran them and failed main on four pushes in a row, each time on a different test because `cargo test` stopped at the first failing binary. Tests now build in release on the same target as the build step, and `--no-fail-fast` shows all failures at once.

- TS/JS import edits preserve exact UTF-8 byte ranges and surrounding same-line code. Duplicate detection uses parsed declarations, and unavailable/invalid parsing refuses edits without changing the file rather than falling back to text matching.

- **`sem.addImport` now locates imports with the tree-sitter parser instead of scanning lines.** A new internal `sem imports` command returns a file's real top-level import statements by position, and `addImport` uses it for TypeScript/JavaScript files to supersede and place imports. Strings, comments and nested declarations are not import targets. Multi-line and non-leading imports are supported. With no imports, insertion appends a top-level declaration to preserve directive prologues and shebangs. Other languages retain their existing behavior.

### Fixed

- **An ABAP class with local classes no longer loses its own definition references.** The local classes in `zcl_foo.clas.locals_imp.abap`, `.locals_def.abap` and `.testclasses.abap` are children of `zcl_foo`'s class in another file, and the reference scan cut every child's line range out of its parent's, as if children lived in the parent's file. Those line numbers then removed unrelated lines of the class's own definition, so a `TYPE REF TO zcl_x`, an `INTERFACES` or a `METHODS` parameter type there made no edge. A child's lines are now cut out of its parent's only when both are in the same file. On abapGit the graph goes from 29543 to 29618 edges, all `typeref`, and `sem find zcl_abapgit_data_deserializer --refs` goes from no references to seven. Output for every other language, Go's receiver methods included, is byte-identical.

- **ABAP literals end at the end of their line.** The grammar let a `'...'` literal run over line ends and had no `''` escape and no token for backtick literals or `|...|` templates, so one misread quote (`''`, `|it's|`) turned the statements after it, up to the next quote, into a single literal. sem's fork of the grammar now ends `'...'` and backtick literals at their line with a doubled quote as the escape, and reads a `|...|` template as one token. On abapGit's 752 `.abap` files the grammar now gives 6818 method nodes for the 7577 `METHOD` blocks, up from 5705; parse-error nodes fall from 39314 to 37305, and entities the ABAP fallback pass has to add from 2917 to 1842. Code that used to hide inside a runaway literal is now parsed, so some files show more error nodes than before.

- **ABAP test class definitions parse.** The grammar read a class definition's additions in one fixed order and had no `FOR TESTING`, `RISK LEVEL` or `DURATION`, so every `CLASS ltcl_x DEFINITION FOR TESTING ...` became an error node. sem's fork of the grammar now takes the additions in any order, test additions included, and `METHODS x FOR TESTING.` as a declaration. On abapGit, error nodes fall from 37305 to 37198, files with error nodes from 731 to 727, and entities the ABAP fallback pass has to add from 1842 to 1756; 90 local `DATA` in test method bodies that the previous fix had let through as class variables are gone again. The chained `METHODS: a, b FOR TESTING.` is not covered yet.

- **An ABAP `*` is a comment only in column 1.** The grammar read any `*` as the start of a comment to the end of its line, so `lv = lines( lt ) * 2.` lost its period and the statement ran on into the ones after it. sem's fork of the grammar now reads `*` comments with an external scanner that accepts a `*` only at the start of a line. On abapGit's `.abap` files, parse-error nodes fall from 37198 to 36558. The scanner also changes where tokens start, which moves the grammar's error recovery around the statements it still cannot read: entities the ABAP fallback pass has to add go from 1756 to 1857 (mostly the methods of three classes whose definitions the grammar cannot read), and one interface the grammar lost whole is no longer an entity. Every `METHOD` block is still a method entity.

- **ABAP chained declarations parse, and class attributes written with them are entities.** The grammar had no chained `METHODS:`, `CLASS-METHODS:` or `INTERFACES:`, no `INTERFACES`, `CLASS-DATA`, `CONSTANTS` or `TYPES` statement at all, and read a class's chained `DATA:` only through error recovery, so a class definition or interface with any of them became an error node. sem's fork of the grammar now reads them, single and chained, with structured types (`dokil-id`, `zif_x=>ty`), `LENGTH`, literal `VALUE`s, `RANGE OF` and table keys. Each part of a class's `DATA:` or `CLASS-DATA` (single or chained) is now a `variable` entity, a `BEGIN OF s ... END OF s` part one variable named `s`. On abapGit, parse-error nodes fall from 36558 to 30435, files with error nodes from 727 to 632, entities the ABAP fallback pass has to add from 1857 to 1685, and `variable` entities rise by 203 (239 class attributes gained, 36 locals, constants and types that error recovery had turned into class variables gone). Code that a definition running on over its implementation used to hide is now parsed, so 30 files show more error nodes than before.

- **ABAP interface method implementations are the grammar's own.** The grammar's names stop at a `~`, so `METHOD zif_foo~bar.` was a method `zif_foo` followed by an error node, and when that node took more than `~bar` the method had no name and the ABAP fallback pass had to add it. sem's fork of the grammar now reads `zif_foo~bar` as one name in `METHOD` and `METHODS ... REDEFINITION`. On abapGit, where 3290 of 7591 `METHOD` statements name an interface method, entities the fallback has to add fall from 1685 to 843 and parse-error nodes from 30435 to 27637; the entities themselves are unchanged.

- **Every ABAP method is an entity, and each ends at its own `ENDMETHOD`.** The grammar does not end a `'...'` literal at its line, as ABAP does, so after a quote it misreads (`''`, a template like `|{ a }*|`) it either dropped the rest of a `CLASS ... IMPLEMENTATION`, losing every method after that point, or ran one method on to the end of the class, so a diff named an edit to a later method as that one. On abapGit only 5161 of its 7577 `METHOD` blocks were method entities, 317 of 624 files missed at least one, and 94 methods spanned another. The removable ABAP fallback pass now cuts its statements from the source with comments and literals blanked, instead of from the grammar's tokens, and reads `METHOD ... ENDMETHOD.` blocks off them: a method the grammar read is kept and cut back to its own `ENDMETHOD`, a method it lost or misnamed (`get_steps` for `zif_x~get_steps`) is added under its class with `source: abap-fallback`, and a class the grammar lost whole is added from its `DEFINITION` and `IMPLEMENTATION` blocks. A `METHOD` with no `ENDMETHOD` is not an entity, as for `FORM`. All 7577 are now method entities and none spans another; `sem diff` on ten hand-checked abapGit pull requests names 63 of the 64 methods a reviewer names, up from 44.

- **An ABAP interface is named after itself, not a later token.** When the statement after `INTERFACE zif_foo PUBLIC.` did not parse (a `##NO_TEXT` pragma, a `TYPES` the grammar misreads), the grammar put the interface's name in an error node and the entity took the name of a later token instead: 48 of abapGit's 113 global interfaces were called `NO_TEXT`, `abap_bool`, `ty_get` and the like, so a diff could show an edit as a delete and an add. The name is now the first name token after `INTERFACE`.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- **A smaller command line: eight verbs, variations as flags.** `sem --help` now lists `find`, `grep`, `impact`, `check`, `certify`, `diff`, `graph` and `history`, the `cloud` and `config` groups, and `mcp`, one line each saying which question the verb answers, with a QUICKSTART for the four agent questions (where is it, what does my change touch, is it correct, what should a human review).
  - `sem find X --callers | --refs | --context` and `sem find --in PATH` replace `callers`, `refs`, `context` and `entities`.
  - `sem impact --diff <range>` takes a whole change; with `--tests` in a JS/TS workspace it uses the module graph's affected-test selection.
  - `sem certify <range> --arch` (with `--html`, `--view`, `--md`) replaces `arch-diff`.
  - `sem graph --modules | --dataflow [--witness] | --system` replaces `topology`, `dataflow` and `system`.
  - `sem history X` and `sem history --blame FILE` replace `log` and `blame`.
  - `sem cloud login|logout|whoami|review|xref|repos|enable|disable` and `sem config setup|unsetup|telemetry|completions|update|stats` group the account and setup commands.
  - Every old command name and flag still works with identical output, JSON included. At a terminal it prints a one-line note on stderr naming the new spelling; in `--json` mode or when stdout is not a terminal it prints nothing extra.
- **`sem mcp` lists the core verbs only:** `sem_find` (with `mode` callers, refs or context, `in`, `text` and `intent`), `sem_grep`, `sem_impact`, `sem_check`, `sem_certify`, `sem_diff`, `sem_graph` and `sem_history`. The earlier tools (`sem_entities`, `sem_context`, `sem_callers`, `sem_log`, `sem_blame`) still answer when called by name. The review-listener tools are listed for `sem mcp --review`, which the review-listener plugin now passes.

### Added

- **`sem check`, an exact incremental verifier.** Runs the project's TypeScript, lint, test, Go, Cargo and configured checkers and prints one verdict: exit 0 pass, 1 fail, 2 could not decide (nothing to check is 2, never a pass). A checker rechecks only what a change can affect when that is provably the verdict of the full tool, and otherwise runs in full and says why; `--json` adds a verification certificate. `--promises` also proves every promise in `.sem/promises` can fail.
- **`sem dataflow --witness` and an experimental execution-witness runner (`witness/`).** `--witness` emits one instrumentation task per static source -> sink flow (Python, TS/JS). The runner has a model propose a harness, runs it in a network-less docker sandbox with a runtime that injects a secret canary at the source, and marks a flow CONFIRMED only when the canary reaches the sink along the claimed path in 3 of 3 runs. See `witness/DESIGN.md`.
- **More Python data-flow sources:** typer/click command parameters, FastAPI route parameters, framework base-class handlers, functions run through `asyncio.to_thread` and executors, typed `*args`/`**kwargs`, and `getattr(self, name)` dispatch.
- **`sem arch-diff --view`, `--html` and `--from-json`.** A ranked, collapsed view of an arch-diff report (at most 10 items that need a human decision, each with what changed and why it matters), a self-contained HTML page with the module graph around the change, and rendering of a saved `--json` report.
- **`sem system deps|fetch|build` (experimental).** A layered whole-system graph (repo code, locked dependencies and stdlib, database schema, config and routes, service contracts, a runtime trace) that gives every call and boundary site one outcome per layer and reports how much of the system is knowable. Optional TypeScript front-end and runtime tracers live in `scripts/system/`.
- **`sem dataflow`, `sem arch-diff <base>..<head>` and `sem certify <base>..<head>`.** `sem dataflow` lowers Python, JS/TS, Go and Rust functions into one IR and reports source -> sink paths with witness paths, matched against declarative models of sources, sinks, sanitizers and callbacks; a call with no known target is an escape, never dropped. `sem arch-diff` reports the architecture delta of a change: new and removed data paths, dependency and cycle changes, signature changes with their unresolved possible callers, broken Python imports and complexity deltas, ranked by severity (text, `--json`, `--md`), in bounded time (`--budget`) and memory (`--max-memory`; above that it analyzes the diff's region and says so). `sem certify` writes a review certificate: touched entities, callers a signature change left unmodified, laws kept or newly broken with their shortest witness paths, affected tests.
- **An exact-or-unknown call graph for Rust, Go and Python.** Each call site resolves to a target set, external, or unknown; a base or trait method call gets dispatch edges to its overrides. It replaces the scope resolver for those languages (persisted facts are invalidated and rebuild on upgrade).
- **`sem topology`** for JS/TS workspaces: the module reference graph (value vs type-only imports, workspace imports resolved to source without a build, asset nodes, dynamic-import patterns), graph metrics (cycles, betweenness, propagation cost, blast radius, affected tests) and laws (`forbid`, `only`, `acyclic`, `layers`, `forbidImport`, `forbidPattern` tree-sitter queries in any sem language). `sem promises check|status|verify` evaluates laws that carry a human promise, and `verify` requires each law to break under its declared mutation. `callsFit` reports Python calls that no longer fit their target's signature.

### Changed

- **Caller answers say whether they are complete.** `sem callers`, `sem impact` and `sem certify` attach a completeness verdict: when an alias, a dispatch registration or an untyped receiver may hide callers, the answer says so and lists the possible callers, nearest first, instead of printing "callers: none" or a green "No tests found". `find`/`callers`/`refs` accept qualified names (`Class.method`, `module.func`, `name@line`) and suggest near matches on a miss; `--file` takes a directory.
- `sem grep` accepts rg-style trailing paths, `-l` and `-n`; `sem context` labels packed entities with `file:start-end`; members of decorated Python classes are extracted; a cold `sem find` builds through the shared graph cache.

- Experimental simple agent sessions now support explicitly acknowledged exact-source reuse and content-only diff reviews since a captured review. Cold file parses run with bounded concurrency, and batch-edit preflight avoids repeated reads of the same file. Validation result reuse is opt-in and requires an operator-owned complete-input fingerprint provider; ordinary checks continue to execute by default.
- **Signature changes and deletions now report the callers a batch left behind.** Before `weave_transaction` deletes an entity or applies an edit with `allow_signature_change`, it asks sem's graph for that entity's dependents and returns the ones the batch did not edit as `caller_review.unedited_dependents`, so a missed caller shows up before the build. The list comes from the syntax-level graph and is a review aid, not a compile check. Out-of-range integer arguments such as `max_entities: 0` are now clamped instead of failing the call, and the pi package README documents the transaction mode as it runs today.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-10-02

### Removed

- **The strict and adaptive transaction policies are gone from pi, leaving the simple structural session policy as the only one.** `pi/config/transaction.mjs` and `pi/config/adaptive-transaction.mjs` are removed, and `config/simple-transaction.mjs` is now the documented configuration for `PI_SEM_MODE=transaction`.

### Added

- **Opt-in simple structural session policy for agents.** `pi/config/simple-transaction.mjs` packages batched exact reads, acknowledged context reuse, scoped edit composition and snapshot-checked edits without fixed discovery/transaction call quotas. Includes regression tests and setup instructions. This policy remains experimental, not a guarantee of faster sessions or semantic completeness.

### Fixed

- **Portable transaction startup and guarded batches.** The simple server starts without JeV credentials; external ranking requires explicit `SEM_JEV_ENABLED=1` plus credentials and task. Same-file exact-edit batches enforce intermediate snapshot guards and roll back earlier writes on a later edit error.

- Experimental structural-session adapter snapshot adds explicitly scoped reads and edit programs, batched discovery, bounded validation evidence, and timeout recovery. Retained as a research branch: benchmark timings vary with agent-selected validation workloads and do not establish a universal speedup.
- Text search includes eligible files without a structural parser (such as Objective-C++ `.mm` and custom build files), including alongside a warm structural index. Search responses preserve coverage limits separately from result pagination; binary content remains excluded.

- Simple transaction edits preserve overloaded entity selectors. Timed-out public checks retain partial diagnostics and restart their disposable checker so subsequent validation can proceed.

- Simple transaction read batches preserve valid results when another selector is malformed or a requested path is rejected as a symlink. Partial captures report their errors explicitly; strict capture and edit checks remain unchanged.

- **Copilot CLI can connect to the MCP server again.** Unsupported discovery probes return `Method not found` without closing the connection, allowing clients to fall back to `initialize` in both standalone and shared modes. Fixes #497.
- **Indexed name lookup sees renames and added definitions in edited files.** `sem find` checks indexed file freshness and reparses changed files on demand, without requiring a whole dependency-graph refresh. Includes TypeScript, Python and Rust regression coverage.
- **Dart dependency graphs now resolve ordinary calls, constructor-bound receivers and typed parameters.** Callers and refs no longer select a same-named Dart method for a TypeScript receiver (or vice versa); imported class owners take precedence. Persisted graph/query caches are invalidated so upgrades rebuild the affected edges. Fixes #491.
- **Shared MCP clients keep independent context history and stay bound to their repository.** Concurrent daemon startup is serialized with an OS lock, stale sockets recover after crashes, and handshakes are bounded. Adds `sem mcp --status` for health checks and reproducible lifecycle coverage on macOS and Linux.
- **Telemetry uploads are no longer rejected by the server.** 0.21.0 removed the install id from the upload payload while the ingest endpoint still required one, so every batch uploaded since then was refused and active-install counts only ever reflected 0.20.0 and older. Uploads now carry `hash(local seed + day number)`, where the seed is generated once, stays on the machine and is never sent, so a batch groups with the rest of that machine's day and with nothing before or after it. Telemetry is still local-by-default and opt-in, so this only changes the contents of an upload that someone enabled with `sem telemetry on`.
- **`sem setup` no longer reports success when part of it failed.** It writes the global `diff.external` config first, then installs the Claude Code hook and the pre-commit hook, and those two steps used to treat a permissions or JSON failure as a warning before falling through to a closing message that listed all three features as live and returned success. An unparseable `~/.claude/settings.json` therefore left changed git config, no hook, and a final line reading "sem is wired in". The closing summary is now built from the steps that actually ran, and a failed step reports what did and did not apply before exiting 2. The successful path is unchanged. Thanks to kantorcodes1 on Reddit for the report.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- **BSL (1C:Enterprise) language support.** Procedures and functions are extracted as entities from `.bsl` and `.osl` files via the alkoleft/tree-sitter-bsl grammar, behind a `lang-bsl` feature included in `grammar-all`. Requested in Ataraxy-Labs/weave#132.

### Fixed

- **TypeScript instance fields are typed from all three declaration forms.** Field types were learned only from an explicit `this.x = ...` in the constructor body, so a field with an initializer or annotation, and a constructor parameter property (the shape most dependency-injection code uses), were never typed and calls through them resolved to nothing. Method-level impact came back empty for DI code (#474).

### Changed

- **Semantic diffs retain added and deleted containers alongside their changed children.** A whole section appearing or disappearing is structural information its leaves do not restate, and a parent rename the matcher cannot confirm is now visible as the Deleted/Added pair rather than only a child move. Modified containers whose own declaration did not change are still suppressed. Based on work in #481.


## [0.24.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **`sem find`, `sem grep`, and `sem context` now accept multiple queries in a single call.** `sem find name1 name2 …` resolves each name independently — a miss on one doesn't affect the others; `sem grep -e pattern1 -e pattern2 …` (rg-style repeated `-e`) keeps each pattern's hits separate; `sem context --entity A --entity B …` packs context for several entities in one invocation, each under the same `--budget`, refusing on an ambiguous or unresolved name the same way the single-entity form does. The MCP `find`, `grep`, and `context` tools gained matching array parameters (`queries[]`, `patterns[]`, `entities[]`). Single-query usage is unchanged.
- **New `sem_callers` MCP tool**, exposing the same reverse-caller lookup as the CLI's `sem callers`. `sem callers` itself gained `--limit` (cap the result list) and now refuses — listing every candidate — when a name matches more than one definition, instead of silently answering for just one.
- **A middle zoom level between an outline and full source: `sem entities --signatures` and `sem context --headers`.** Each shows an entity's signature (up to where its body starts) plus the first line of its leading doc comment, instead of either the bare name alone or the full body. Available over MCP as `signatures: true` on `entities` and `mode: "headers"` on `context`.

### Fixed

- **sem-mcp's `format` parameter now applies everywhere `entities` can return results.** It was previously honored on some response shapes but ignored on others: `entities`' free-text and query-ranking modes always rendered human-readable text even when `format=json` was requested, and the cloud-served directory-listing fast path always returned raw JSON even for the default text format.

## [0.23.1] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **CSV, JSON, and Vue entities no longer collide on generated ids with entities from other files.** Their id-generation scheme is now disambiguated per plugin, closing a gap where two entities could silently collapse onto the same id and one would drop out of the graph.
- **Entities from non-code files (Markdown, TOML, YAML, JSON, CSV, Vue/Svelte) now carry accurate byte ranges**, so tools that rely on byte offsets (extraction, editing, highlighting) work correctly for these file types instead of getting an inaccurate span.
- **Markdown headings that appear inside a fenced code block are no longer parsed as real document headings.**
- **TypeScript/JavaScript entity byte spans now include a leading `export` keyword when present**, so extracting an exported declaration's exact source text no longer drops the `export ` prefix. Facts schema v4 — existing caches rebuild automatically on first use.
- **`sem entities` no longer opens the git repository through libgit2 on every call.** That was a fixed per-call cost regardless of file size, disproportionately noticeable on small-file lookups; it's now only paid when actually needed.
- **sem-mcp's `query` and `limit` parameters on the `entities` and `context` tools now work correctly** (previously ignored).

### Added

- **sem-mcp: new `find` and `grep` tools**, giving MCP clients the same fast entity-lookup and trigram-accelerated search already available from the CLI (`sem find`, `sem grep`).
- **sem-mcp: `entities` and `context` tools accept `format=json`**, returning structured JSON instead of human-readable text for callers that want to parse results programmatically.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **C++ and Python's precomputed-facts fast paths are now opt-in (`SEM_MUL_CPP=1`, `SEM_MUL_PYTHON=1`), and Rust's stays opt-in (`SEM_MUL_RUST=1`).** These fast paths trade memory for speed by skipping a second parse of files whose facts are already known. Re-measuring peak memory footprint (the metric that actually tracks memory pressure and swap risk, as opposed to resident-set size, which can look artificially low once memory has been compressed) found C++ costing ~25-28% more than a default build on llvm-project and Python ~22-25% more on home-assistant/core — both above the project's +15% admission ceiling, even after a follow-up trim narrowed the gap. Rust independently re-measured at ~33% over. Cold builds on large C++/Python repos are correspondingly slower by default than in 0.22.1, but use less memory; set the relevant env var if you have RAM headroom and want the speed.
- **Go's fast path is now on by default**, no configuration needed. It cleared the same ceiling (+6.8% to +8.5% peak memory footprint on Kubernetes, well under +15%) once the correctness fixes below landed, and delivers a 12-17% faster cold build on Kubernetes as a result.

### Fixed

- **Go call resolution no longer merges same-named packages from different API groups.** Kubernetes has dozens of packages literally named `v1` — one per API group (`kubeadm`, `bootstraptoken`, `pod-security-admission`, and more) — and import resolution used to key packages only by their bare directory name, so a call like `DeepCopyInto` from one API group's type could resolve to a same-named method in a completely unrelated package. Packages are now disambiguated by their full import path. This alone removes roughly 32,000 false cross-package edges on Kubernetes, and (combined with the fix below) makes Kubernetes cold builds 28-30% faster.
- **Go resolution no longer confuses a source file's own name with a standard-library package it happens to share a name with.** Large Go codebases routinely contain files literally named `os.go` or `time.go`; a secondary lookup route used to treat a file's own bare filename as if it were an importable package, so calls like `os.Stat()` or `time.Now()` could resolve to the local file instead of the real standard-library package. That route has been removed entirely — only the correct, directory-based lookup remains.
- **Rust call resolution no longer confuses an external standard-library import with a same-named local module.** `use std::cmp;` followed by `cmp::max(...)` could previously resolve to an unrelated local `cmp.rs` instead of the real standard-library function. Imports rooted at `std`/`core`/`alloc` are now excluded from local-module matching outright (an external import can never legitimately resolve to a file in your own repo), and a genuine same-named local-module collision is now disambiguated per the specific item being called rather than per whole-file bucket, falling back to an honest miss instead of guessing when it can't be told apart.
- **Fixed a scope-resolution precedence bug affecting every supported language: a nested closure or sibling function could resolve a call to the wrong same-named target** — for example, a TypeScript call landing on a sibling closure's function of the same name instead of the one actually being called. A function's own locally declared bindings now always take precedence over an outer scope's binding of the same name, and nested locals inside a plain function (not just a class or module) are now registered for lookup at all, closing a gap where they were invisible to their own siblings.
- **Go's cross-file method resolution is now internally consistent when the fast path is enabled.** Rewriting a method's identity to reflect its true cross-file package location left other places that cache that identity out of date, which could push a call through an unrelated fallback path instead of the correct local lookup. Every place an entity's identity is cached is now kept in sync with the rewrite, and the fast-path build is now bit-identical to the default build on Kubernetes.
- **Multi-document YAML files (`---`-separated) no longer lose entities to id collisions.** Top-level keys sharing a name across different documents in the same file used to collapse onto one generated id, silently dropping all but one from the graph — including whether it was a test. Each document is now part of the generated id whenever a real collision exists; ordinary single-document files are unaffected.
- **`sem entities`'s index-backed listings no longer come back empty on Windows.** An absolute path built by ordinary path-joining wasn't normalized the same way as the repository root before comparison, and Windows always prepends its extended-path marker during normalization, so the two could never match. Two related normalization gaps in the MCP server and the index reader were fixed alongside it.
- **Fixed a parse-cache test flake** caused by tests sharing global cache state under parallel execution; the cache is now injectable per test/thread, with no change to production behavior.
- **`sem setup` no longer installs a SessionStart hook that forks `mcp --resident`.** That resident server was deleted in 0.22.0 (`--resident` is kept only as a no-op flag for old installs), so every fresh `sem setup` was forking a process that does nothing, once per Claude Code session. `sem setup` now installs only the `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`sem hook prompt-submit`); `sem unsetup` still recognizes and removes a legacy `mcp --resident` SessionStart hook from an older install.
- **Caches written by the MCP server no longer silently drop test-coverage flags read by the CLI.** `sem-cli` and `sem-mcp` each maintained their own copy of the on-disk cache format, and a prior perf fix landed on only one of the two copies — any cache last written by the MCP server ended up with permanently empty test flags. The two copies are now one shared implementation, so both read and write the same, complete cache.

### Added

- **New internal diagnostics**: a dangling-edge check that catches any graph edge pointing at an entity id nothing declared (always a bug, never legitimate), plus a set of resolution counters behind `SEM_PROFILE_RESOLVE` for measuring how often lookups fall back to slower paths. Development/debugging aids, not user-facing commands.
- **The internal reference-consistency checker used by sem's own test suite got dramatically faster** — from about 100 seconds to well under a second on a large TypeScript codebase — by resolving each entity through one lookup table instead of a per-entity search. Not user-facing, but it makes sem's own correctness checks practical to run at scale.
- **Per-field memory attribution** for the experimental fast-path facts, letting future memory work target the specific data structure responsible for a footprint regression instead of guessing.

### Performance

- **Kubernetes cold builds are 28-30% faster**, from the same package-index disambiguation fix described above.
- **Builds against an empty or fresh facts cache no longer pay a needless per-file cost.** Recognizing an empty cache directory now takes one directory read instead of checking every candidate file, cutting cache-merge time on an empty cache from ~245ms to ~0.4ms and making a full cold build roughly 7% faster.
- **The experimental fast-path facts now use about 17% less memory**, by trimming unused capacity left over from incremental construction and deduplicating repeated identifier strings within each file. Wall-clock time is unaffected.

### Removed

- **The Go package-index builder's second, hand-duplicated copy** — one shared implementation is now used everywhere a build needs it.
- **Five internal, already-closed measurement tools** (micro-benchmarks and one-off memory/timing probes) whose results were already recorded elsewhere and are no longer needed to reproduce them.
- **`sem-mcp`'s own duplicate disk-cache implementation** — superseded by the shared implementation described above.
- **The file-stem Go package-resolution route** — see Fixed, above; only the directory-based route remains.

## [0.22.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- **`sem find` / `sem callers` / `sem refs`**: new query verbs that answer directly from the mmap `index.sem` — entity definitions, direct callers (reverse edges), and direct refs (forward edges) — without touching `cache.db`.
- **`sem grep <pattern>`**: trigram-accelerated text search over the mmap index. A required-trigram query against the index's `TRIGRAM` section narrows the candidate file set, each candidate is then verified with the real regex matcher against its *current* bytes (never stale stored content), and output is `rg`-compatible `file:line:text`. Beats `rg` 11-26x on giant repos (measured on the TypeScript monster and home-assistant-core corpora: 25-53ms vs. `rg`'s 283-980ms for the same pattern). Falls back to a full scan for patterns no trigram query can be derived from.
- **`sem review listen <diff-id-or-url> [--dry-run]`**: one-command agent attach to a hosted sem-cloud review. Resolves credentials, validates the diff exists, locates the review-listener plugin, and execs `claude` with the documented flags/env. `--dry-run` prints the assembled command with secrets masked, without launching or requiring `claude` to be installed.
- **Three new sem-cloud MCP tools** (`join_review`, `wait_for_branch`, `reply_to_branch`) let an agent join a hosted code review as a live listener: long-poll for reviewer questions anchored to lines of a diff, investigate them in the repo, and stream answers back. Ships with a Claude Code plugin (`integrations/claude-review-listener/`) that wires the tools up and adds a read-only Stop-hook backstop for headless sessions.
- **`sem diff`'s hosted upload no longer blocks on the local caller/callee relations pass.** With cloud consent on, the diff snapshot uploads immediately with empty relations; the server queues enrichment and replies "enrichmentQueued" (or, against an older server, the CLI runs the existing local pass and PUTs the result afterward). `SEM_RELATIONS_LOCAL=1` restores the old blocking single-upload behavior; the local relations pass's own budget is now adaptive to repo size.

### Performance

- **Cold graph builds are 11-30% faster and peak RSS is down 17-40% on giant corpora, versus 0.21.** Measured end-to-end on the shipped release binary: home-assistant-core 5.9s, TypeScript monster 11.2s, dotnet-runtime 46.7s, llvm-project 34.7s, linux 35.2s cold full-CLI (warm rebuilds: 0.2-1.3s). Every corpus improved on both the engine-only and full-CLI metrics.
- **C#/C++ builds now skip re-parsing files whose facts are already known**, closing the last gap in precomputed-facts reuse (JS/TS/Python/Go/Java/Rust already had it). A per-file gate proves a corpus-wide invariant — no entity's parent lives in a different file — before trusting precomputed facts wholesale, so this needed no facts-schema change. Measured on dotnet-runtime: reparse time drops from 10.6s to 65ms.
- **Parsed file facts now persist to disk as a content-addressed corpus**, so a build that has seen a file's exact content before warm-starts it instead of re-parsing from scratch, even in a fresh process. Fixed a regression where checking a shared corpus against a large number of prior contributors got slower as the corpus grew (one repo's known-content rebuild was measured 332% slower against a 7.9GB shared corpus than a 556MB one); it now costs the same regardless of corpus size.
- **`sem context` regained a fast tier it had lost, by reading each entity's body from its own file at an indexed byte span instead of walking and hydrating the whole corpus.** A prior cascade of cache removals deleted the old fast path along with a correctness bug it had, but left `sem context` always doing a full corpus load — measured on the TypeScript monster 1.11s down to 48ms, on a mid-size repo 0.16-0.28s down to 4.6ms. Verified byte-identical against the always-correct full-load path across both entity- and file-scoped lookups; still declines (never approximates) on a stale cache, an ambiguous name, or any entity missing a span.

### Changed

- **`sem mcp --resident`'s standing sidecar process is gone.** With index-backed queries answering in single-digit milliseconds from a cold process, the resident's whole reason for existing (avoiding a ~800ms SQLite hydrate) no longer applies — it measured 0% availability at scale, a 300ms tax, and 2.6GB of idle RSS. `SEM_NO_SIDECAR` and `SEM_NO_AUTOWARM` are gone with it; the `--resident` flag itself stays as a no-op for compatibility.

### Fixed

- **`sem --version` now reports the correct version.** The `v0.21.1` tag only bumped `sem-core`, leaving `sem-cli`, `sem-mcp`, `sem-plugin`, and `sem-cloud-client` at `0.21.0`, so the binary still reported `0.21.0`. Bumped those crates (and their internal path dependencies) to `0.21.1` to match the tag. Thanks @chenrui333 (#480).
- **Building a graph over Svelte components no longer crashes (SIGSEGV) on Linux/glibc.** `sem graph`/`context`/`orient` over `.svelte` files deterministically exited 139 from an invalid free in the `tree-sitter-htmlx-svelte` 0.1.8 grammar's scanner, hit during parallel graph construction (macOS's allocator tolerated the bad free, so it only showed on Linux). Bumped the grammar to 0.1.16, which carries the scanner fixes; the existing version constraint already permitted it, so this is a lock-only dependency update. Added a parallel-Svelte-graph regression test. Thanks @XF-FW for the exhaustive isolation and the verified fix (#471).

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **Cloud-enabled `sem diff` now creates an immutable, owner-private hosted review URL.** Snapshot uploads include changed-entity caller/callee relations and truthful Git provenance: branch, scope, base/head refs, and available SHAs. Working-tree reviews explicitly report `HEAD → WORKTREE` rather than implying that uncommitted changes exist on GitHub.
- **GitHub login can now be exchanged for a revocable CLI session.** Raw GitHub credentials are not persisted as sem credentials, and the CLI session resolves to the same stable principal used by web reviews.

### Fixed

- **Hosted-review upload failures are visible without breaking the local diff.** `sem diff` still exits successfully with its complete local result, while stderr explains that the private review could not be uploaded.
- **Transitional cloud repository states refresh immediately.** `sem whoami` no longer leaves a repository stuck at a cached `pending` state after cloud indexing has completed.
- **`sem diff` now collapses contiguous line chunks on unsupported files into one summary line.** When a file has no grammar, sem falls back to fixed 20-line chunks, so deleting or adding one previously printed a wall of `⊖ chunk lines 1-20 [deleted]` / `21-40` / `41-60` … lines that ate context for no information. Contiguous chunks of the same change type now consolidate to a single line, e.g. `⊖ 13 chunks  lines 1-246  [deleted]`. Verbose mode (`-v`) is unchanged, since it still prints per-chunk content. Thanks @graipher for the report (#466).

### Performance

- **`sem context` now answers from an indexed point query instead of loading the whole graph, so it scales to millions of entities.** It previously hydrated every entity (plus decompressed bodies) just to answer about one, so on a 2.3M-entity repo each call took ~15s. The SQLite cache is already normalized and indexed, so when the git oracle proves the cache fresh (no filesystem walk) `sem context` now builds only the k-hop neighbourhood around the target straight from the store: batched `IN (...)` edge queries, bodies fetched per hop, stopping once there is enough content to cover the token budget so a hub entity's fan-out does not explode the fetch. It reuses the existing packer on that subgraph, so output is byte-for-byte identical to the full-graph path, and falls back to the full load whenever the oracle declines. On the Linux kernel (2.31M entities) `sem context` drops from ~15s to 0.44s per call; on Kubernetes (520k) from ~5s to ~1.2s.
- **Default (`All`-mode) `sem impact` now answers from the indexed cache too, instead of hydrating the whole graph.** A full cache stored entities and edges but not test flags, so All/Tests-mode impact (which includes the "covered by N tests" answer) fell through to a full-graph load — ~3.5s on Kubernetes, ~10.7s for an unbounded `--depth 0`, even for a tiny blast radius. The full save now records test flags (shared with the topology save) behind a metadata marker, so the existing point-query path can serve All-mode impact straight from indexed edge queries. Output is identical to the full-load path — verified byte-for-byte against it, including the tests field. On Kubernetes (520k entities) default `sem impact` drops from **~3.5s to 0.04s**, and `--depth 0` from **~10.7s to 0.04s**. Caches built before the marker still take the full path, so nothing regresses.
- **The resident MCP server no longer holds the whole graph in RAM by default, cutting idle memory dramatically.** It used to proactively build and keep the entire deserialized graph in memory on startup so the first query would be warm — ~671MB on Kubernetes, ~5GB on the Linux kernel. But `context` and `impact` now answer from the indexed cache directly, and the CLI's fast paths bypass the resident entirely, so that proactive hold is mostly wasted memory. Prewarm is now opt-in (`SEM_PREWARM`); by default the resident stays light and builds the full graph lazily, only when a query that genuinely needs it (graph/diff/text) runs. On Kubernetes an idle resident drops from **671MB to 10MB**.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- **Indexing now shows a staged loader with a real, whole-build progress bar, not a single "Building entity graph" spinner.** A cold graph build renders each phase sem-core reports as a persistent `◆` line — `Scanning files — N found`, `Parsing code — done` — and a **single filling bar with a live percentage spans the entire build**: the build is two passes over the file set (parse, then resolve), so the bar's length is 2×files and its position is (files parsed + files resolved). It tops out at ~50% when parsing finishes and only reaches 100% when resolution actually completes — so 100% means genuinely done, not "parsing done." Fed by two lock-free per-file counters (`graph_parse_done`, `graph_resolve_done`) via phase hooks. Ends with the existing `✓ N entities · M files in …ms` summary. Warm cache fires nothing and stays instant; TTY-only, so agents, pipes, the MCP server, and CI see nothing (the bar's poll thread never even spawns off a terminal).
- **`sem setup` now shows a staged progress loader instead of a flat list of check lines.** Setup runs as a small tree of steps — `git diff → sem diff`, `Claude Code hooks`, `pre-commit hook` — each with a live braille spinner that resolves to a green `◆` (did something), a dim `·` (nothing to do / not applicable, e.g. not in a git repo), or a yellow `⚠` (left a file untouched on purpose, e.g. an unparseable `settings.json`). It ends with a one-line summary and the `sem unsetup` revert hint. Same idempotent behaviour, just legible at a glance.

### Added

- **sem-core: `set_build_phase_hook` / `clear_build_phase_hook` / `BuildPhase` + `graph_parse_done` + `graph_resolve_done`** — an optional per-thread callback at graph-build phase boundaries (parsing, resolving) plus a lock-free counter of files parsed, so a front-end can render staged progress and a live parse bar. No-op for every caller that doesn't read them.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-05

### Removed

- **Removed `sem orient` and all fuzzy/ranked retrieval.** The `orient` command and its `--pack` briefing, the sem-core ranking (lexical scoring, IDF, recall net, structural priming), the `sem_entities query=` intent-search mode, and the resident server's `orient` socket op are all gone. Ranking a natural-language task to the right entity proved unreliable — a 45-task validation showed the ranker's hit-rate (~47%) could not be lifted by heuristics without causing regressions — and it was the only non-deterministic thing in sem. sem is now purely deterministic: `context` (read an entity plus its callers/callees), `impact` (blast radius), `diff`, `entities` (list by path, or `text=` for exact-substring search), `blame`, `log`. To find code whose name you don't know, use a plain text search to get a candidate name, then hand it to `sem context` for the structure grep can't give. The prompt-submit hook keeps its deterministic exact-name prefetch and no longer shells out to the ranker.

### Fixed

- **Dot-chain extraction is now linear, not quadratic, in file size.** `extract_dot_chains_with_positions` computed each match's line number by counting newlines from the start of the file every time, so on a large file dense with `a.b` chains the cost was O(matches times filelen). Since the regex yields matches in increasing byte order, it now tracks the line number incrementally and counts only the newlines since the previous match, which is linear overall and produces identical one-based line numbers. Verified byte-for-byte identical graph output on React (34,251 entities, 73,702 edges). No change for typical files; it removes a cliff on very large generated or minified sources.

- **Structural hashing no longer allocates a Vec per AST node.** The two structural-hash walkers (`hash_structural_tokens` and its name-excluding variant) collected every internal node's children into a fresh heap `Vec` (plus a fresh tree-sitter cursor) just to push them in reverse, despite a comment claiming zero allocations. They now reuse a single cursor and push children in place, reversing the appended slice, which is byte-for-byte identical output. On a cold graph build this removes roughly 300k allocations (structural hashing alone dropped from about 319k allocations to 13.5k, measured with dhat on deno). Peak RSS is unchanged and wall time is within noise under mimalloc, but the churn reduction helps memory-constrained and non-mimalloc builds. Hashes are verified identical across 3,337 entities, so rename detection and existing caches are unaffected.

### Added

- **`sem setup` now makes sem a Claude Code session default (macOS/Linux).** Beyond the `git diff` alias, it installs two session hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`: a warm resident graph (SessionStart runs `sem mcp --resident` detached, so structural queries answer in single-digit ms instead of rebuilding) and prompt-time context injection (`sem hook prompt-submit`). The JSON edit is idempotent, backs up `settings.json` first, refuses to touch a file it can't parse, and preserves every existing user hook and key; `sem unsetup` removes exactly the sem hooks and cleans up empty arrays. Local warmth is free and login-free — cloud (`sem login`) is repositioned in the README as the scale/team/CI upgrade, not the way to get warmth.

### Documentation

- **Benchmarks page rebuilt on the July 2026 paired-run data.** The docs site's benchmarks page now reports the real agent A/B numbers (grep+read agent vs sem agent on SWE-bench Verified bugs, hidden-test graded): 50-65% faster code understanding, verify loop 2.90s to 0.59s per iteration when call-graph edges resolve (bimodal, 1.2x floor disclosed), token parity stated plainly, and an explicit "what sem does not do" section including the unchanged solve rate. Retired the stale "75% fewer tokens" and "2.3x agent accuracy" hero claims. Changelog page gains entries for v0.17-v0.18 work with the lessons that produced them.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **sem now works on repos using git's reftable ref storage** (`git init --ref-format=reftable`, git 2.45+). Previously every command died with libgit2's cryptic `unsupported extension name extensions.refstorage`. libgit2 can't read reftable refs, but the object database and index are unchanged, so GitBridge now tolerates the extension and routes just the ref resolutions (`HEAD`, refspecs, revwalk starts) through the git CLI while libgit2 keeps doing everything else by OID. Verified end to end on a real reftable repo: working/staged/commit/range diffs, blame, and per-file history all produce identical results to a files-backend repo. One residual gap: the cache freshness oracle's direct `git2::Repository::open` is `.ok()`-guarded, so on reftable repos it just skips the acceleration (correctness unaffected). Requires `git` on PATH for the ref lookups. Thanks @bengry for the report and clean repro (#451).

### Added

- **Unique-method-name call edges (dynamic languages).** Attribute calls on receivers of unknown type (`index.keep_levels(...)`) previously produced no graph edge, hiding real dependents and blinding `--tests`. In Python/Ruby — where receiver types are statically unknowable — a method name with exactly one definition repo-wide now resolves to it: one candidate, one edge; any ambiguity, no edge. Static languages keep precision-first resolution (an unresolved receiver there is deliberate: shadowed import, instance property).
- **`Parent::child` entity qualifiers.** `sem impact "Dataset::set_index"` and friends now work everywhere `Parent.child` does (graph and cached lookups).

- **`sem impact --tests` lexical fallback + fast-path fallthrough.** Graph edges miss tests that call a target through a module namespace (`xr.where(...)` resolves to no entity), so `--tests` could answer "No tests found" for a function with dozens of tests. Now: an empty tests answer from the sidecar or disk cache is treated as non-authoritative and falls through to the full path, which backstops zero graph edges with lexical reachability — test entities naming the target as a whole word — clearly labeled as weaker evidence. Found live: an agent's graph-selected verify loop (run only the tests that reach your change) went from 0 selected tests to a 56-test net on `xr.where`, versus the 1,900+ tests of whole-file runs.
- **Sharper `--pack` briefings.** Term ranking is now IDF-weighted (a term appearing in half the repo is worth almost nothing), `<details>` environment dumps in issue text are stripped before extraction, attribute accesses glued to receivers ("d2.loc") also emit their `.attr` suffixes as terms, and one of the three briefing slots goes to the top name-echo orient hit — for bugs where the issue names a surface API the culprit's body never mentions.

- **`sem orient --pack <tokens>`: turn-zero briefings from task text.** Feed orient a whole issue or task description and it returns a packed briefing — the top matching functions' bodies plus their immediate callers/callees — sized to the token budget. Ranking is body-term convergence: code-ish terms are extracted from the task text (flags, dotted names, identifiers) and entities are ranked by how many distinct terms their bodies contain, since issue vocabulary lives in bodies, not names. Built for prompt-time injection (the agent-side analog of the prompt-submit prefetch hook): the code an agent would spend its first turns foraging for arrives at turn zero. Honest calibration: on three ground-truth issues it put the exact target function first on two; issues that quote the tool's own output can still poison term extraction.

- **sem is published to the official MCP registry** as `io.github.Ataraxy-Labs/sem`, so MCP clients that browse the registry (VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, and others) can discover and install the server directly. The release workflow now publishes each release to the registry via `mcp-publisher` (authenticated with GitHub OIDC, no extra secrets), backed by a `server.json` manifest and an `mcpName` field in the npm wrapper.

### Performance

- **Delta-fills: changed entities answer with a diff against the version your session saw.** The attention ledger now stores fill contents, so when a session re-asks about an entity that changed since its last look, the answer is an entity-level delta (`∆ alpha · changed since you read it … - x = 1 / + x = 42`) instead of the whole packed body. Measured end to end: a post-edit re-ask that previously re-sent the body now costs 2 diff lines. Completes the ledger's answer set — new entity: full fill; unchanged: one line; changed: delta; `SEM_FRESH=1` / `fresh: true` always forces the full re-pack. Deltas larger than 120 lines fall back to a full fill.

- **Attention ledger covers the MCP path.** `sem_context` (the tool agent sessions actually call) now runs through the same per-session fill ledger: an MCP server process serves exactly one session, so re-asks for unchanged entities collapse to one `≡ unchanged since you read it` line automatically — no environment variable needed. New optional `fresh: true` param forces a full re-send (for when context compaction dropped the earlier fill).

- **Attention ledger v1: repeated context fills collapse to one line.** The resident server now keeps a per-session ledger of every `context` fill it has emitted (entity id + content fingerprint). When the same session re-asks for an unchanged entity, the answer is a single `≡ unchanged since you read it` line instead of the full packed body — the body is already sitting in the asking model's context window, so re-sending it is pure token waste. Measured through the CLI socket path: 8,586 bytes first fill, 139 bytes on repeat (98.4% suppressed). Opt-in via `SEM_SESSION=<id>` in the environment; `SEM_FRESH=1` bypasses; anonymous calls are never suppressed. Any change to the target entity misses the fingerprint and re-sends in full. This is the first piece of the attention architecture (docs/attention-architecture.md): space (graph), time (commit index), attention (ledger).

- **`sem entities --text`**: entity-addressed text search from the CLI (the MCP tool already had it) — one line per hit (file, innermost entity, line, matched text) instead of whole bodies, served from the resident server's warm graph in milliseconds with a local-graph fallback. This is the token-cheap way for an agent to verify a call site or find a string: a body-level `sem context` costs hundreds of tokens where a text hit costs ~15.

- **Auto-resident server: every sem CLI query after the first answers in milliseconds, on any repo.** A socket miss now spawns `sem mcp --resident` (hidden plumbing) detached in the background: a server that holds the repo's graph warm and serves ONLY the per-repo unix socket, exiting on its own when idle for 30 minutes or when it loses the bind race to a live session. `sem context` and `sem orient` gain sidecar fast paths (impact already had one), so the full structural read loop runs against the warm graph: measured on a 30K-LOC repo, first `sem context` 0.68s cold (spawning the resident), then context/orient/impact all under 10ms. In a controlled agent benchmark (6 verified code-understanding questions, classic grep/read agent vs sem agent, identical prompts and batching guidance), the sem agent answered in 13s vs 37s with equal 6/6 correctness — 65% faster. `SEM_NO_AUTOWARM=1` disables the auto-spawn, `SEM_NO_SIDECAR=1` the fast path.

- **Token-efficient tool output**: the same answers at a fraction of the tokens the consuming model has to read (and pay for). (1) The context packer stops enumerating noise: related test entities are folded into per-role counts instead of packed as one-line "#[test]" stubs (unless the target itself is a test, when its test neighborhood is the question), bare attribute/comment signatures are skipped, and transitive tiers are capped at 25 entries per role with the remainder counted. What was dropped is stated explicitly in one line ("not packed: +64 direct dependents (64 tests) · sem_impact lists them"), so the signal survives at a fraction of the cost. Measured: `sem context` on a hot sem-core entity 7,272 to 4,113 tokens (-43%, 119 to 48 entries); on a hot weave entity 5,216 to 3,498 (-33%, 146 to 27 entries, the 119 test stubs now one line). (2) The `sem_entities` MCP tool renders compact per-line trees (name · type · lines, children indented, files as group headers) instead of pretty-printed JSON: measured 3.7x fewer tokens on a 115-entity file (5,028 to 1,361). Applies to the MCP path and query modes; CLI `--json` output is unchanged for scripts.

- **Semantic commit index (storage engine layer 2)**: history is now stored as entity deltas. Each commit is semantic-diffed against its first parent exactly once and persisted as entity-change rows in the cache (`commits` + `entity_changes` tables, sha-keyed and branch-agnostic); every later history query is a SQLite lookup plus a diff of only the commits git gained since. Measured on the sem repo: `sem log` over 500 commits drops from 4.46s to **0.03s** on the second query (~150x), with the first query as the one-time indexing pass and each new commit costing one incremental diff. Applies to `sem log` repo analytics (hotspots + co-change pairs) and the MCP `sem_log` tool; per-entity traces are unchanged. Aggregation is shared code between the live git walk and the store (`aggregate_history_analytics`), tested to produce identical hotspot/co-change output, so the two paths cannot drift. Merge-heavy history gets better semantics: each commit is attributed its own first-parent diff instead of a diff against its arbitrary revwalk neighbor, and merge commits contribute no changes of their own (their first-parent diff restates the merged-in commits, which index individually). File-filtered queries index full-repo diffs once and filter at aggregation, so the first filtered query costs more than the old pathspec-scoped walk but every later query on any filter is instant. Cache schema v9; existing caches rebuild automatically on first use.

- **CLI sidecar fast path**: `sem impact` now answers from the resident `sem mcp` server's warm graph via its unix socket before doing any local work — measured **4.5ms** end-to-end on a 158K-LOC repo, versus 22.4ms for the local cold path and 7.7ms for a ripgrep scan of the same repo: the full blast radius (callers, dependencies, depth-bounded transitive impact, affected tests) is now cheaper than a raw text match. Output is byte-identical to the local path (the sidecar ships serialized `EntityInfo`s that the CLI feeds to its existing printers; verified across all modes and `--json`). The fast path is an accelerator, never a requirement: bounded socket timeouts and silent fallback mean no resident server (or `SEM_NO_SIDECAR=1`, `--no-cache`, custom scopes, `.semignore`, `--entity-id`) just runs the normal local path. Server-side, the new sidecar `impact` op classifies affected tests only among the entities the impact BFS actually reached, instead of walking the whole corpus per call (6.8ms → 0.1ms on a 4.7K-entity graph).

### Fixed

- Internal: rustfmt line-wrap missed in the #445 sidecar change; no behavior change.

- The context packer's token estimator was undercounting real tokens 2-3x on dense code (words x 1.3 vs the ~4 chars/token reality: a context reported as 661 tokens measured ~2,400 real tokens), silently overshooting every budget. It now takes the max of the word- and character-based estimates, so nominal budgets match what the consuming model actually pays.

- The context packer's "not packed" summary line pluralizes roles correctly ("transitive dependencies", not "dependencys").

- Workspace version bumped to 0.16.0: `ContextResult` gained the public `omitted` field (a breaking change for struct-literal constructors, flagged by cargo-semver-checks), and 0.x semantics put breaking changes in the minor version.

- The docs site deploys through workflow-based GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/docs-pages.yml`: upload `/docs` verbatim, deploy) instead of the legacy branch-based Jekyll builder, which began failing repo-wide with zero-duration "Page build failed" errors on commits that didn't touch docs — including on direct build requests via the Pages API. The site is pure static HTML, so the legacy builder added nothing but a failure mode; deploys now also skip entirely on commits that don't change `docs/`.

### Changed

- The GitHub Action's PR-comment footer now tells the reader what to do next — "add it to your repo in 2 minutes", linking to the action's install snippet — instead of only naming the tool. Every entity-diff comment is seen by all of a repo's collaborators; the footer is the loop that turns viewers into installs.

### Added

- **`sem repos`** — where your code is stored, in one command. Two inventories side by side: the **cloud account** (authoritative `GET /v1/repos`: every indexed repo with status, entity/file counts, last-indexed time, indexed commit, and any indexing error rendered inline) and **local storage** (every entity cache under the sem cache root with size on disk, entity count, cache kind, and the repo it was built from). `--json` for scripts. Listing the account also reconciles this machine's `~/.sem/repos.json` mirror with server truth — stale entries (a repo registered mid-index stays "pending, 0 entities" forever otherwise) were silently mis-routing the local-vs-cloud decision for impact/context queries. Caches are now stamped with their repo root at save time (`repo_root` in `cache_metadata`); caches built before this show as unlabeled and self-label on their next rebuild.

- Fish shell support, via the `tree-sitter-fish` grammar (gated behind the `lang-fish` feature in `grammar-all`). Extracts functions — including the config.fish pattern of definitions inside a top-level `if status is-interactive` block — and resolves fish call edges (a `command`'s name against repo functions, builtins excluded), so `sem impact` sees which fish functions call which. A `function` defined inside another function stays part of the outer entity's content, matching fish's runtime semantics (inner definitions become global, not lexical children). Previously `.fish` files fell back to generic line-based chunking with an unsupported-language warning. Thanks @thalys for the request (#433).

### Documentation

- **First-principles page on the docs site** (`docs/first-principles.html`, linked from every page's nav): four charts explaining why the recent latency work changes what an agent can afford to do, not just how fast it runs — the scan-vs-index crossover (a text scan pays per byte; residency removes the index's ~800ms hydrate floor, so the constant-time line wins at every repo size), the ~100ms human-perception threshold every new path now sits under, model turns as the real cost unit (3 → 2 → 1 inference turns per structural answer via one-call lookup, then prompt-time prefetch), and tokens per answer (the measured ~15% entity-tree-vs-JSON ratio). Measured numbers come from this changelog; model curves and turn timings are labeled illustrative on the page. Charts are dependency-free inline SVG with hover tooltips and a table view each.

### Performance

- **Content-store cache (storage engine layer 1)**: the entity cache no longer duplicates source text per entity. Each file's text is stored once (zstd) in a `file_contents` table, and any entity whose body is provably a byte slice of it (`content == file[start_byte..end_byte]`, verified at save time) stores NULL content and is re-sliced on load; unprovable entities (no spans, normalized endings) keep content inline. On a 139K-entity corpus (fresh cache both sides) this cut the cache 20% (269MB to 216MB; the content layer itself −58%, 80MB to 24MB inline + 10MB zstd), engaged for 77% of entities. Honest costs: warm full-content loads pay ~0.13s extra for decompress+slice on that corpus (0.38s to 0.51s); topology loads and the MCP server's in-memory hot path are unaffected, and cold build time is unchanged within noise (peak RSS ~−5%). Correctness gates: byte-identical graph vs the previous binary on the full corpus, byte-identical entity content round-trip (including multi-byte unicode and nested entities), and incremental saves keep the file store in sync with entity deletes. Cache schema v8 — existing caches rebuild automatically on first use.

### Added

- **Entity-addressed text search**: `sem_entities` takes a `text` parameter — an exact substring searched across entity bodies in the warm in-memory graph (no file reads). Hits come back addressed by the innermost enclosing entity (`file: entity (Lline): matched text`), ready to chain into `sem_context`/`sem_impact`, in ~20-30ms warm on an 85K-LOC repo. This retires the main remaining reason agents fell back to grep (strings, error messages, config keys); misses say honestly that comments between entities and non-code files are not covered.

### Performance

- Graph build: the scope resolver no longer allocates its debug resolution log (several owned strings per reference, discarded by every production path — only a bench consumed it), and edge dedup is index-based instead of cloning both entity IDs per edge into a hash set. Output is byte-identical (proven edge-for-edge on a 139K-entity build); ~1-3% fewer instructions retired. Groundwork toward #320/#322 — the remaining peak-memory work (entity content sharing, ID interning) is tracked there.

### Added

- **`sem hook prompt-submit`** (hidden plumbing): the prompt-time prefetch, compiled. Reads a Claude Code UserPromptSubmit event, extracts identifier-shaped tokens from the prompt (backticked, snake_case, CamelCase, qualified — never plain words), resolves them against the resident server's socket sidecar, and prints packed entity context for injection. **10ms end-to-end** (was ~40ms as a Python hook — interpreter startup and a git subprocess, both eliminated: repo root is found by walking to `.git` in-process). Silent on conversational prompts, slash commands, unknown names, or when no server is resident.

### Added

- The socket sidecar is unix-only (`cfg(unix)`): Windows builds skip it with a no-op and the prefetch hook falls back silently — the sidecar is an accelerator, never a requirement. (Fixes the Windows build break the sidecar introduced.)
- **Socket sidecar**: `sem mcp` now exposes the warm in-memory graph on a per-repo unix socket (`~/.sem/sock/<repo-hash>.sock`, one JSON line in, one out). Short-lived local callers — the prompt-prefetch hook, future CLI fast paths — get one-call entity context in single-digit milliseconds instead of paying a fresh process plus SQLite hydrate (~800ms). Stale sockets from dead servers are detected and taken over; the sidecar is a silent accelerator, never a requirement.

### Added

- **One-call lookup**: `sem_context`'s `file_path` is now optional. With only an `entity_name`, the entity is resolved across the whole repo (unique match proceeds; ambiguity returns a compact candidate list with the files; no match returns near-name suggestions) and the body plus callers/callees comes back in a single round-trip — one agent call where grep needs two (search, then read). Measured 26ms wall on a prewarmed server, name-only, unfamiliar repo.

### Performance

- The sem MCP server is now **local-first and prewarmed**. Cloud-first routing on `sem_impact`/`sem_context` cost a network round-trip on every call before the local answer (and carried the same wrong-entity risk gated in the CLI); it is now behind `SEM_MCP_CLOUD=1` until the server resolves name+file strictly. The server also builds the CWD repo's graph in the background at startup, so the agent's first structural query answers from memory. Measured on an 85K-LOC repo: warm `sem_context` runs in under 1ms wall (faster than a ripgrep scan of the same repo), and the first call dropped from 129ms cold to ~0 with prewarm.

### Removed

- Team presence was pulled from the `--badge` package before it shipped as a feature (product call: not a feature for now). The statusline no longer shows teammates and the hook sends nothing anywhere; the dormant server endpoints remain unadvertised.

### Added

- The `--badge` statusline is now **live at trigger time**: a PreToolUse hook flips the badge to an animated spinner with the entity name the moment the agent calls sem (`⊕ sem ⠹ impact validateToken…`), and the completed state (count, latency, savings) lands when the call finishes. The render hot path never touches the network (renders measured at ~20ms).

### Fixed

- The `sem context` / `sem_context` budget packer no longer starves the target while neighbors feast. Previously a target too big for the budget collapsed to its first line (2 tokens) while a single large dependency could consume the entire budget with its full body. The target now degrades gracefully — full body → head-truncated body (docstring, fields, leading code, with an explicit `… truncated: N more lines` marker) using up to ~70% of the budget → bare signature — and no neighbor may cost more tokens than the target itself did (budget/10 floor), oversized neighbors degrading to signatures. On the same query (a large class, budget 2000) the target went from 2 tokens to 1,398 and the answer-relevant attributes are now in the payload.

### Added

- **Entity-level history analytics**: `sem log` with no entity now analyzes recent repo history in one pass and reports **hotspots** (the most-changed code entities, with commit counts, distinct authors, and the last commit that touched each) and **co-change pairs** (entities that repeatedly change in the same commits, with a confidence score — "these two never change apart"). Counts are per commit, code entities only (doc headings, config properties, and lockfile chunks are excluded so the signal is about code), and bulk commits touching >50 entities are excluded from pair-counting to keep quadratic noise out. Same via MCP: `sem_log` without `entity_name`. `--file` scopes to one file; `--json` returns everything. This is the time axis a snapshot dependency graph cannot see: which code churns, and which code moves together.

### Changed

- `sem_impact` MCP results now render as a **blast-radius tree** (`◉` header, one `├─▶` branch per file, real callers first, all-test files sunk to the bottom, nothing elided) — expanding the tool widget is the live graph, no separate viewer process needed. The bundled skill also instructs agents to draw the blast radius as a small ASCII tree directly in their reply when an impact result drives the answer.

- `sem_impact` and `sem_context` MCP results now render as a compact entity tree instead of pretty-printed JSON: dependents/dependencies/transitive impact grouped one line per file, every entity name preserved, with the elapsed time and source in a footer. The same information lands in about 15% of the tokens, and the expanded tool widget in agent UIs reads at a glance (`⊕ entity · file`, `← 29 dependents · 10 files`, `⚡ 70 transitively affected`). Context entries keep their verbatim content under a per-entry header.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- `npx @ataraxy-labs/sem-skill --badge` (opt-in) installs a live sem badge in the Claude Code statusline: it shows how many structural queries ran this session, the last command **and the entity it analyzed**, its latency, a sparkline of recent latencies, and a rotating stat (distinct entities analyzed, top command) (`⊕ sem ×12  impact validateToken 9ms  ▁▂▃▅▂  · 7 entities analyzed`). It is fed by a PostToolUse hook that catches sem via **both** the MCP tools and the `sem` CLI (Bash), and falls back to recent activity so the badge never stalls on "idle". Non-destructive: it backs up settings and never overwrites an existing statusline (it prints how to add the badge yourself instead).
- **GitHub Action** (`Ataraxy-Labs/sem/action`): entity-level semantic diff comments on pull requests. One sticky comment per PR showing which functions/classes/methods were added, modified, or deleted, updated in place on every push; cosmetic-only PRs (formatting/comments) are called out explicitly. Installs the prebuilt binary (~2s), needs no config or API keys, and never fails the build. sem's own PRs now dogfood it via `.github/workflows/pr-entity-diff.yml`.
- The savings meter now lives in the **statusline itself** — no extra process. The `--badge` badge always shows the live estimated time + tokens this session's sem calls saved vs grep+read (`⊕ sem ×5 diff · ≈ 4m · ≈ 25k tokens saved`), and when idle it shows the lifetime total (`⊕ sem idle · ≈ 3h · ≈ 190k tokens saved`). The PostToolUse hook is the single writer of the persisted lifetime tally (`~/.claude/sem-savings.json`), so the counter grows from real usage whether or not the live viewer is open. Estimates stay anchored to the measured benchmark and labelled `≈`.
- Live viewer for the `--badge` install: `~/.claude/sem-live.py` (run it in a spare terminal pane). It redraws an ASCII blast-radius graph each time sem runs — the analyzed entity, its direct callers (real ones surfaced, test fan-out collapsed), and the transitive count — plus a **savings meter**: a running, honestly-estimated tally of the grep+read round-trips, time, and tokens sem saved this session, and a lifetime counter persisted across sessions (`~/.claude/sem-savings.json`). Estimates are anchored to a measured benchmark and labelled `≈`. The badge hook now also records `--file` and cwd so the graph can be reconstructed.

### Fixed

- Repository discovery now tolerates Git worktrees that use the `extensions.relativeworktrees` config key, avoiding libgit2's unsupported-extension error when plain `git` can open the checkout.
- Cloud-backed `sem impact` / `sem context` no longer answer queries they can't answer correctly. Two gates added: `--no-cache` now always computes fresh locally (previously the cloud snapshot was served anyway), and **file-hinted queries (`--file`) stay local** — the cloud resolves entities by name with a silent name-only fallback, so for same-named entities (e.g. ten `fn run` command handlers) it could return the *wrong entity's* graph, and a stale cloud index could drop dependents that exist locally. Local resolution disambiguates exactly; the cloud path returns once the server resolves name+file strictly and exposes its indexed commit for a freshness check.
- Impact/dependency resolution now follows type-qualified associated calls (`Type::method()`) when the receiver is a known repo type, so a caller reached only through a static/associated path is no longer dropped from `sem impact`. Previously, e.g., a test helper calling `SemPlugin::detect_changes()` was invisible to the reverse-dependency graph, and its transitive callers were missing from the blast radius. Resolution stays precise: a bare module path (`foo::bar::baz()`) still does not bind to a same-name local function, and common associated names (`Type::new`, `::default`) are not guessed.

### Performance

- Faster graph hydrate on large repos. The public `EntityGraph` maps now use `rustc-hash` (FxHashMap) instead of std SipHash, matching the build's internal maps, and the SQLite cache sets read pragmas (`mmap_size`, `cache_size`, `temp_store=MEMORY`) on every connection. On a 200K-entity / 800K-edge graph this is about 9% faster to hydrate (0.42s to 0.39s, no overlap across repeats); negligible on small repos. Output is byte-identical.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed

- Whole-repo commands (`sem graph`) now skip the file-discovery walk when git proves the cache is fresh (HEAD unchanged and the working tree clean), serving the cached topology directly. On a 200K-file repo this is about 9x faster with git fsmonitor and about 4.5x faster without it; small repos and non-git repos are unchanged. The oracle only ever declines to accelerate, never serves stale results, and the `git status` check is time-bounded (`SEM_FRESHNESS_TIMEOUT_MS`) with `SEM_FRESHNESS=scan|git|auto` to override.

### Added

- `sem xref` lists cross-repo dependencies across your indexed repos: entities in one repo that depend on entities in another. A single-repo local graph can't see this, so it's a cloud feature (requires `sem login`) and is gated to the team/enterprise tier. Adds `cross_deps()` to the shared cloud client.
- `sem diff` now prints a one-line hint, when run interactively and logged out, that `sem login` reveals what your changes break across repos (a cross-repo question a local single-repo diff can't answer). It is heavily throttled (at most once a week), shown only on a terminal with real entity changes, and stays completely silent in CI, pipes, `--json`/non-terminal output, and for logged-in users.

### Performance

- Cache freshness checks now run the per-file `stat` + content-hash scan in parallel (rayon) instead of sequentially (#351). On touched-file cache hits over large repos, the freshness scan was the dominant remaining cost (~42ms of sequential filesystem/hash work on a 5K-file touched scenario); it now scales across cores. SQLite reads stay serial (the connection isn't shared across threads) and fingerprint-refresh writes remain serial and best-effort — only the pure filesystem+hash work is parallelized, so cache-hit validity is unchanged.

### Documentation

- The bundled `/sem` agent skill no longer hardcodes a language count. It said "31 languages", which went stale as grammars were added and disagreed with the README ("32") and the crate description ("28"); it now says "30+ languages" so it can't drift, and an en-dash was replaced with a hyphen.
- README: documented the optional cloud acceleration flow (`sem login` serves `impact`/`context`/`entities` from a warm pre-built graph for large repos; local is unchanged and `SEM_LOCAL=1` forces local), and added Lua to the supported-languages table.

### Added

- Lua support, via the `tree-sitter-lua` grammar (gated behind the `lang-lua` feature in `grammar-all`). Extracts global, `local`, table (`t.f`), and method (`t:f`) functions. Thanks @mmgeorge for the request (#393).
- `SemanticEntity` now carries optional `start_byte`/`end_byte` offsets, populated from the underlying tree-sitter node during code extraction. A consumer can slice the exact original bytes of an entity out of a file given only its `file_path` and span, without re-parsing. Persisted through the entity cache and surfaced in `sem entities --json`. Thanks to Thomas J. for the request.

### Added

- `npx @ataraxy-labs/sem-skill`: one-command setup of sem for coding agents. Installs the sem skill into `~/.claude/skills/` and registers the `sem mcp` server, so an agent uses sem (impact / context / orient / diff) over grep for structural questions without manual setup. Builds on the skill contributed in #376.

### Added

- An agent skill (`skills/sem/SKILL.md`) documenting sem's semantic diff, impact, blame, history, context, and graph workflows for coding agents. Thanks @linhlban150612 for the contribution (#376).
- `self-update` Cargo feature (on by default) gates the built-in `sem update` and the background update-available check. Distro and package-manager builds that own the binary's lifecycle can opt out with `cargo build --no-default-features`; `sem update` then prints a "update through your package manager" message instead of replacing the binary. Thanks @0323pin (pkgsrc/NetBSD) for the request (#390).

### Added

- `sem context --hops N` bounds the related entities to N graph hops from the target (instead of filling to the token budget), so you can ask for "the entity and just its immediate neighborhood." The `sem_context` MCP tool gains the same `hops` parameter. 0 (the default) keeps the existing unbounded, budget-driven behavior.

### Changed

- The `sem mcp` instructions now tell agents to read code with `sem_context` (which returns an entity's full source plus its callers/callees, addressed by name) rather than opening the file, reserving direct file reads for editing and non-code. Reading by entity is robust to line drift and arrives with the dependency context.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Release pipeline: the Intel macOS cross-build failed on `openssl-sys` (no target-arch OpenSSL when cross-compiling on Apple Silicon). It now builds OpenSSL from source via `--features vendored-openssl`, the same approach the Linux arm64 cross-build uses. 0.14.0's binaries never published because of this; 0.14.1 is the first release to ship binaries for every platform, including Intel macOS (#374).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `sem orient <query>` finds the entities most relevant to a query, structural code search for when you're dropped into an unfamiliar codebase and don't know the symbol name yet (e.g. `sem orient "where is the retry logic"`). Two-pass ranking: lexical score over entity name (subtoken + prefix/stem + substring), file path, and signature line, then a graph-centrality re-rank so a central, widely-used entity outranks a trivially-named helper. Results show the entity, its `file:line`, signature, and dependent count. `--json` and `--limit` supported. This is the structural counterpart to grep: grep finds text, orient finds the entity and how connected it is.
- The `sem_entities` MCP tool accepts a `query` parameter for the same intent search, so agents can find code by what it does (not just by name) without falling back to grep. The ranking is shared with the CLI (`sem_core::parser::orient`).
- `sem orient` down-weights entities in test files so implementation outranks an equivalently-named test. Test functions often match a query strongly by name, but the implementation is almost always what you want; tests stay findable, just below the real code.
- `sem entities` accepts `--only <kind>` and `--except <kind>` (both repeatable) to filter the listing by entity kind, e.g. `sem entities --only function --only struct` or `sem entities --except import`. The two flags are mutually exclusive. Because entity kinds are language-dependent, an unknown kind reports the kinds actually found in the scanned files rather than guessing a static list. Thanks @aleclarson for the request (#378).
- `SEM_WIDTH` sets the terminal-diff box width. sem's per-file box was a fixed 55 columns with no TTY attached, so it didn't match the surrounding pane when used as a pager (e.g. `lazygit`). Set `SEM_WIDTH=<columns>` to control it. Thanks @franky47 for the request (#380).

### Fixed

- The Intel macOS binary now builds reliably. The release built `x86_64-apple-darwin` on a native Intel `macos-13` runner, which GitHub is retiring, so the job could queue indefinitely and stall the whole release (0.13.1's binaries never published for this reason). It now cross-compiles on Apple Silicon `macos-14`, where runners are plentiful. 0.14.0 is the first release to ship Intel macOS binaries.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- `sem impact` can answer direct dependency queries from a fresh SQL topology cache without rebuilding the entity graph.
- `sem entities` reports phase timings and listing counters when `SEM_TIMINGS` is enabled.
- Optional OSC8 terminal hyperlinks on entity names in `sem diff`, so a supporting terminal (kitty, WezTerm, iTerm2, Ghostty, ...) renders them clickable and can open the definition at `file:line`. Off by default; enable with `SEM_HYPERLINK` set to an editor preset (`vscode`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `zed`, `idea`, `file`) or a raw URI template using `{file}` and `{line}` (e.g. `SEM_HYPERLINK="vscode://file/{file}:{line}"`). Strictly TTY-only, so pipes, JSON output, and MCP/agent sessions never see escape codes. Force off with `SEM_NO_HYPERLINKS=1`. Thanks @olejorgenb for the request (#381).

### Changed

- The `sem mcp` server now sends usage guidance to the agent instead of a bare tool list. The instructions tell the agent to prefer `sem_impact`/`sem_context`/`sem_entities` over grep/find for structural questions (what calls X, understand X, where is X) and to keep grep for text search and non-code files. Availability alone wasn't changing agent behavior; this biases agents toward the entity graph the moment the server connects, with no extra setup.
- `sem impact --deps` can reuse fresh caches when unrelated files change by validating the cached source set, hashes, and import metadata before falling back to a graph rebuild.
- `sem impact --deps` narrows cache freshness checks to the queried entity, direct dependencies, and relevant JavaScript/TypeScript imports when the query scope is explicit.
- Source scans skip default-excluded high-volume paths such as generated source directories, fixture/vendor/benchmark trees, generated file suffixes, CSS module declarations, and asset declarations; pass `--no-default-excludes` to include them.
- `sem entities` accepts `--file-exts` for large directory scans and avoids duplicate directory-listing post-processing.
- `sem entities` can list entities from a fresh SQLite topology cache instead of reparsing matching directory scans.
- `sem entities --json` streams rows to stdout instead of materializing an intermediate JSON value array.
- `sem entities` uses listing-only extraction so local listings do not retain source text or entity hashes.

### Fixed

- Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) is now built and published. The release matrix only produced Apple Silicon (`arm64`) macOS binaries, so Intel Mac users got a 404 from `install.sh` and "Unsupported platform darwin:x64" from npm. Added the `x86_64-apple-darwin` target to the release build and the `darwin:x64` mapping to the npm wrapper. Thanks @stark-bit for the report (#374).
- TOML array-of-tables entries no longer collapse to a single entity in `sem diff`. Repeated `[[array]]` headers all reduced to the same id (`...::property::array`), so appending an entry showed up as a modification of the previous one instead of an addition. Each `[[key]]` entry now gets an index-based identity (`key/0`, `key/1`, ...) and is hashed independently, mirroring the JSON array-index handling. This also stops a `[key]` table and a `[[key]]` array-of-tables with the same name from colliding. Thanks @Arpafaucon for the report and analysis (#362).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Kotlin: resolve method calls through typed receivers that the `tree-sitter-kotlin-ng` grammar exposes positionally (no `name`/`type` fields). Several scope-resolution paths used field names from the older grammar and silently produced no call edges. Fixed: typed function parameters (`fun f(s: Scenario) { s.method() }`); class field types from property declarations (`val conn: Connection`) and primary-constructor properties (`class Tx(val conn: Connection)`); chained field access (`val s = container.scenario; s.method()`); and declared/inferred return types, so `val c = get(); c.method()` resolves. `sem context`/`impact`/`log` now find these Kotlin callers. Thanks @mrsirrisrm.
- Java: name field entities by their declarator instead of their type. `private FooService fooService;` was extracted as an entity named `FooService` (its type) rather than `fooService`, because `field_declaration` has no `name` field and the generic fallback returned the first type identifier. This also collided class and field names in the symbol table. `sem entities`/`diff`/`log` now report the correct field name. Thanks @mrsirrisrm.
- Java: resolve cross-file `receiver.method()` call edges. Local variable types weren't recorded (`Dog d = new Dog()` and `object_creation_expression` RHS were ignored), class field types weren't tracked, and `ClassName.staticMethod()` calls were dropped, so `sem impact`/`context` reported few or no cross-file dependents on Java, a false negative that read as "safe to change." The Spring field-injection pattern (`@Inject private FooService foo; ... foo.bar()`) now resolves. Thanks @mrsirrisrm.
- On Windows, the MCP tools `sem_impact`, `sem_context`, and `sem_log` never resolved an entity: `resolve_file_path` returned OS-native (backslash) relative paths while graph entities store forward-slash `file_path`s, so the `(name, file_path)` match always failed. Relative paths are now emitted with forward slashes on all platforms. Thanks @Turntwo.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- While the spinner is up, sem shows a rotating one-line tip about another useful command underneath it, like the hints under Claude Code's spinner. `sem diff` (the most-used command) now shows the spinner during its compute, so you learn about `sem impact`, `sem context`, `sem blame`, the MCP server, etc. while you wait. Strictly stderr and TTY-only, so it never touches output, pipes, JSON, or agent sessions, and disappears when the work finishes. Disable with `SEM_NO_PROGRESS=1`.
- After a slow local build (3s+) when you're logged out, sem prints one dim line with the time you just spent and notes that sem cloud serves the same graph warm in milliseconds. Throttled to once a day, TTY-only, and uses your real elapsed time (no inflated claims). Disable with `SEM_NO_PROGRESS=1`.
- The MCP server (`sem mcp`) now keeps its in-memory entity graph live with a background file watcher. Previously `sem_impact` and `sem_context` re-walked and re-stat'd the entire repo on every call just to check whether the cached graph was still fresh, which on a large repo is real per-call overhead. A watcher now tracks filesystem changes, so calls where nothing changed return the cached graph instantly (no walk, no stat), and an edit triggers an incremental rebuild of only the changed files. Your uncommitted edits are reflected without restarting the server. Disable with `SEM_NO_WATCH=1`.

### Changed

- Graph resolution now uses faster hash collections in hot paths to reduce graph build overhead.
- Scope resolution caches repeated reference lookups during graph builds to reduce redundant resolver work.
- Graph builds avoid retaining import scan source text after import extraction, reducing peak memory use.
- `sem context` now prints the full source of the target entity in the terminal. It previously showed only the first line, so reading a function meant falling back to `--json`. Related entities still show a one-line signature so the context map stays scannable.
- `sem context` and `sem impact` (CLI and the `sem_context` / `sem_impact` MCP tools) now accept `Class.method` (and `Outer.Inner.method`) to address a method by name, not only the bare method name or a full entity id.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `super::module::func()` calls were dropped from the entity graph, so `impact` and `context` under-reported the blast radius across modules. Multi-segment Rust path-prefixed calls (`super::`/`crate::`/`self::`) now resolve to the real entity.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `sem impact` now shows the uv-style progress spinner during the cold graph build (it's the most-used graph command). Same stderr/TTY gating as `graph` and `context`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Progress spinner for slow graph builds. `sem graph` and `sem context` now show a uv-style spinner and a summary line (e.g. `135,298 entities, 7,743 files in 6.6s`) while building the entity graph. Strictly stderr and TTY-only, so pipes, JSON, and agent/MCP sessions are unaffected. Disable with SEM_NO_PROGRESS=1.

- SQL support (`.sql`, `.psql`, `.pgsql`, `.ddl`) via the official DerekStride/tree-sitter-sql grammar. Extracts tables, views, materialized views, functions, indexes, types, schemas, triggers, sequences, and databases. Thanks @robahtou for the request (#339).
- Start tracking project changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add a pull request check that asks contributors to include a changelog entry.
- `sem entities` accepts multiple file or directory path arguments.

### Changed

- Sparse checkouts now work. libgit2 cannot read a sparse index (`unsupported mandatory extension: 'sdir'`) and its workdir diff reported sparse-excluded files as deleted; sem now routes working and staged diffs through the git CLI when a sparse checkout is detected. Thanks for the report (#330).

- README now documents adding the MCP server to coding agents (`claude mcp add sem -- sem mcp`) and explains why `sem mcp` exists. The old section pointed at a separate `sem-mcp` binary; `sem mcp` ships in the main binary.

- `sem stats` now counts every diff, including runs that find no changes (previously those returned early and were never recorded, so `diffs performed` undercounted).

- Telemetry no longer records development builds (debug builds, or binaries run from a Cargo `target/` directory), so contributor and CI-of-our-own usage stays out of the numbers.

- Cloud sync only auto-registers repos that GitHub confirms are public. Private repos run locally unless you opt in with `SEM_SYNC_PRIVATE=1`.
- `install.sh` verifies the release archive against `checksums.txt` before installing.
- Switched the Perl grammar to the official `ts-parser-perl` crate (was the unattributed `tree-sitter-perl-next` copy). Properly attributed, correctly MIT-licensed, and includes upstream fixes: an infinite-loop hang on malformed input, better error recovery, and faster parsing. Thanks @rabbiveesh for the report (#355).

### Removed

- `sem verify` (function call-arity checker). It saw negligible use and overlapped with compilers/LSPs; removing it keeps the surface area focused.
