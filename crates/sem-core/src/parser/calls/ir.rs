//! The language-neutral intermediate representation a language front end
//! lowers one file into. Everything downstream (scopes, type inference,
//! target selection) reads only these types, never a syntax tree, so a new
//! language plugs in by producing a [`FileFacts`] — nothing else changes.
//!
//! The IR is deliberately small: just enough of a file's *declarations*
//! (modules, imports, functions, types, traits, impls) and of each function's
//! *expressions in call position* to answer "which declaration does this
//! call site bind to?". Anything the front end cannot lower becomes
//! [`Expr::Unknown`] / [`TypeExpr::Unknown`], which downstream turns into an
//! explicit `Unresolved` outcome rather than a guess.
//!
//! Expressions are the high-volume part (every call site, every `let`), so
//! they live in a per-file arena: nodes refer to each other and to interned
//! identifiers by `u32` index, and a call chain's sites share its prefix.
