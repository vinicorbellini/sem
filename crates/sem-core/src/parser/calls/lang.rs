//! The seam a language plugs into. A language supplies three things:
//! a lowering (syntax tree -> [`FileFacts`]), a layout (how files form a
//! module tree and which crates/packages are importable by name), and a few
//! tables of *data* about its standard library. The name-resolution, type
//! inference and target-selection stages are shared and never branch on the
//! language.
