//! Red-green incremental resolution: per-file facts, resolve-time read sets, and
//! the invalidation rule that decides which files must be re-resolved after an
//! edit.
//!
//! # The invariant this module exists to enforce
//!
//! A cached resolution result is valid only if the file's *own* facts **and**
//! everything its resolution actually read are unchanged (closure
//! reasoning: "kappa alone authorizes no hit"). Over-approximating the read set
//! is merely slow. Under-approximating it silently serves stale edges, which is
//! the one unforgivable failure — so every lookup that can reach another file's
//! data is recorded, and anything not recorded is handled by a whole-table guard
//! that forces a full re-resolve rather than a quiet reuse.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! * **Facts layer.** [`FileFacts`] is the content-addressed per-file bundle:
//!   content hash, extracted entities, and the tree-independent scope/ref facts
//!   (`PrecomputedFileFacts`) resolution needs. It is `serde`-serializable so the
//! on-disk corpus change can persist it unchanged.
//! * **Read sets.** During resolution every file accumulates a [`ReadSet`]: the
//!   set of `(table, key)` pairs its resolution consulted, hashed to a `u64`.
//!   Recording happens at the lookup site, so a key is recorded whether the
//!   lookup hit or missed — a *miss* is a dependency too (a later edit that adds
//!   that key must invalidate the file).
//! * **Fingerprints.** After every build, each global table is fingerprinted as
//!   `key_hash -> value_hash` ([`TableFingerprints`]). Two builds' fingerprints
//!   diff to the exact set of changed keys.
//! * **Invalidation.** A file is RED if its own content changed, if it is new or
//!   deleted, or if its read set intersects the changed-key set. Because the
//!   global tables are rebuilt from *all* files' facts before the diff is taken,
//!   the changed-key set already reflects every edit transitively — no fixpoint
//!   iteration over file-to-file dependencies is needed, and the result is more
//!   precise than one (a file that reads a *different* key of a changed file
//!   stays GREEN).
//!
//! # Edge ownership invariant
//!
//! **An edge belongs to the file whose reference produced it.** Scope-resolution
//! edges are collected per file inside the pass-2 closure; bag-of-words edges are
//! collected per file inside the resolution closure. A GREEN file's edge list is
//! reused verbatim, in the same position in the merge order the cold build would
//! have produced it. A RED file's edge list is dropped whole and re-derived. No
//! edge is ever half-owned: nothing merges edges across files before the per-file
//! lists are captured.

/// **Reuse eligibility.** Files whose *detected* language is JS/TS, Python, Go,
/// or Rust may go GREEN (extended this past JS/TS-only, 's
/// original scope — see [`crate::parser::import_resolution::
/// is_reuse_eligible_file`]). Every other language's resolution reaches
/// cross-file data through paths this crate does not yet attribute per file
/// (Swift call signatures, or a generic-table read never exercised by a

/// # Ownership: the cache is *moved* through a build, not copied
///
/// There is one per-file cache map, not a `prev` and a `next`. The
/// session hands its map over at the start of a build and takes it back at the
/// end; a GREEN file's entry is therefore **already** in the right place holding
/// exactly the right value, and reuse costs no write at all. Before this, a
/// GREEN file's edges were deep-cloned out of `prev` and deep-cloned back into
/// `next` — 39,058 files' worth of both on every warm rebuild of the TypeScript
/// monster — and then the whole of `prev` was freed.
///
/// What that move costs is an invariant that used to hold for free. When `next`
/// started empty, "there is an entry for `p`" meant "this build resolved `p`",
/// so a read set could only ever be compared against the fingerprints of the
/// build that *immediately* preceded it. A moved map can carry an entry across a
/// build that never looked at it (the file was deleted, or its per-file closure
/// produced nothing), and comparing that entry's read set against the next two
/// builds' fingerprints would silently miss a change that happened in between —
/// the stale-edge failure this module exists to prevent.
///
/// [`CachedFileResolution`]'s two generation stamps restore the invariant
/// directly: every stage stamps the halves it wrote or re-validated, and
/// [`finish`](Self::finish) drops every entry no half of this build claimed and
/// resets every half it did not. The map that comes out is entry-for-entry what
/// the freshly allocated `next` used to be.
