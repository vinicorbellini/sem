//! Entity dependency graph — cross-file reference extraction.
//!
//! Implements a two-pass approach inspired by arXiv:2601.08773 (Reliable Graph-RAG):
//! Pass 1: Extract all entities, build a symbol table (name → entity ID).
//! Pass 2: For each entity, extract identifier references from its AST subtree,
//!         resolve them against the symbol table to create edges.
//!
//! This enables impact analysis: "if I change entity X, what else is affected?"

/// rebuild on the TypeScript monster corpus.
///
/// # Why per-file removal is exact here (no separate key index needed)
///
/// Every one of these five tables' entries is a pure function of *one
/// file's own entities* — a name, an id, an owner name, a parent id, a
/// range — never of another file's content. Concretely:
/// * `entity_map`: keyed by entity id; an id is globally unique and always
///   produced by exactly the file that declares it.
/// * `symbol_table`: keyed by entity *name*, but every id it stores under
///   that name was pushed by exactly the entity that owns it — the file
///   that owns the id is unambiguous from the id alone.
/// * `class_members`/`owner_members`: keyed by owner name / parent id, but
///   this crate's entity model never links a `parent_id` across a file
///   boundary (AST containment is inherently file-local for every
///   supported language, Go's receiver-based "members" included — see the
///   Go branch below, which derives its owner from the member's own
///   `content`, not a cross-file lookup). So a member's *old* owner name is
///   recoverable from that same file's *old* entity list alone.
/// * `entity_ranges`: keyed directly by file path — trivially per-file.
/// * `child_ranges`: keyed by parent id, and the *only* one of the six where
///   a bucket can legitimately hold two different files' contributions —
///   `resolve_go_method_parent_ids` can point methods in several `.go` files
///   at one struct's id. So this one is removed *by value*, one occurrence per
///   old child, rather than by dropping the bucket; see the removal loop.
///   Recomputing an old child's range from `prev_entities` reproduces exactly
///   what the last build inserted, because `child_ranges_for_file` is a pure
///   function of one file's own (unchanged) entities.
///
/// This means `prev_entities` (already threaded through `BuildCarry` for
/// GREEN-entity reuse) is already the exact per-file key index *removal*
/// needs — nothing new has to be built for `O(touched files)` removal,
/// unlike `import_table`'s dedicated `import_keys` side table (import-table
/// keys are `(file, name)` pairs with no equivalent existing index). A
/// file's entry survives in `prev_entities` past the GREEN-reuse step in
/// `build_incremental_core`'s pass-1 loop exactly when phase 1 below needs
/// to touch it: GREEN files are removed from it (nothing to remove), so what
/// remains after that loop is precisely {this build's RED files} ∪ {files
/// deleted since the last build}. **Insertion is driven separately, by the
/// caller's `dirty` set** — `prev_entities`'s remaining keys are empty on a
/// cold build (there is nothing to remove yet), so using it to also gate
/// insertion would silently build empty tables on every session's first
/// build; `dirty` names every file needing fresh entries whether or not it
/// had a previous one.
///
/// # Fingerprinting
///
/// The five fingerprinted tables' entries are now updated key-by-key too
/// (`scope_resolve::fingerprint_corpus_tables_incremental`, driven by the
/// [`scope_resolve::TouchedCorpusKeys`] this function returns), against a
/// session-owned fingerprint map. The whole fold remains the fallback — and
/// the parity oracle: `SEM_FP_PARITY=1` makes every build recompute it and
/// assert the two agree. Because `fingerprint_corpus_tables` is a pure
/// function of whatever map it is handed, a correctly maintained table
/// produces
/// byte-identical fingerprints to a fresh whole rebuild — every read-set/
/// GREEN-decision test already in this crate's suite (`assert_warm_matches_
/// cold`, `assert_import_churn_matches_cold`'s explicit fingerprint-parity
/// assertion, `every_file_whose_edges_change_is_red`, the per-language
/// oracle fixtures) exercises this function on every mutation shape it
/// covers, since every one of them calls `GraphSession::rebuild`.
///
/// # Where this is NOT used
///
/// Only called when `!retain_parsed_files` (i.e. only on corpora over
/// `PARSED_FILE_REUSE_LIMIT`, which resolve in chunks — the TypeScript
/// monster's regime). Under `retain_parsed_files`, pass 1 re-extracts every
/// file's entities on every rebuild regardless of dirty status (see that
/// function's own doc comment for why — it needs live trees for the
/// resolution closure), so `prev_entities` never sheds a genuinely
/// unchanged file's entry there and this function would do full

/// largest bucket left after scope resolution and bag-of-words collapsed
/// 33x/4x: 1,471ms of a 3,438ms warm rebuild on the TypeScript monster
/// corpus, rebuilding the same ~230k entries for ~39,000 files whose imports
/// did not change, every time.
///
/// # Design
///
/// `import_table` is treated as persistent state, not a fresh `HashMap` per
/// build. Every entry's key is `(producing file's own path, name)` — proven
/// in `build_import_table_with_default_export_paths`'s own comment on its
/// parallel merge (e996964): `scan_import_file` runs exactly once per unique
/// `file_path`, and every entry it can produce is stamped with that same
/// `file_path`, so no two different files' entries can ever collide on a
/// key. That is what makes per-file removal and insertion structurally safe.
///
/// A file is either:
///
/// * **GREEN for import-table purposes** — its own content is unchanged, it
///   is JS/TS (the only language this function attributes precisely; see
///   below), it was scanned before, it has no bare-specifier default/
///   namespace import, and every key its last production consulted still
///   holds the value it held last build. Its entries are left untouched in
///   `import_table`.
/// * **RED** — everything else: every non-JS/TS file, every file the caller
///   named as changed, every file new to this build, and every file whose
///   read set caught a real dependency change. Its previous entries (tracked
///   in `import_keys`, so removal is `O(that file's own key count)`, not a
///   full-table scan) are removed and its freshly resolved entries are
///   inserted.
///
/// # Why GREEN is a per-key test, not just "content unchanged"
///
/// Unlike scope resolution and bag-of-words (whose GREEN test is entirely
/// about *this file's own* references), an import-table entry's *value* can
/// depend on a file the importer never touches syntactically: `import Foo
/// from './bar'` resolves against whatever `bar.ts` currently exports as its
/// default, and `bar.ts` changing that must invalidate the *importer's*
/// entry even though the importer's own content did not change. Two read
/// sets cover this:
///
/// * **`Table::SymbolTable`** (already fingerprinted by
///   `scope_resolve::fingerprint_corpus_tables`, moved to run *before* this
///   function in `build_incremental_core` for exactly this reason) covers
///   named imports and named re-exports: `resolve_named_import_tracked`
///   records every name a file's `pending_named_local`/
///   `pending_named_re_export` list looks up, hit or miss, so "some other
///   file started declaring the name I import" is caught the same way
///   `resolve_ref`'s own `Table::SymbolTable` reads are.
/// * **`Table::TsExportSurface`** (new; see its doc comment) covers default
///   and namespace imports, which resolve against corpus-wide tables
///   (`default_exports`, `named_exports_by_file`, top-level entities) built
///   fresh every build from every file's own scan — cheap
///   (`import_table_export_build_ns` measured single-digit ms even at
///   monster scale, so no incrementality is needed *there*; what changes is
///   that a file importing from `T` records a read of `T`'s combined
///   export-surface hash for every path its module specifier could resolve
///   to, so `T` gaining, losing, or changing an export invalidates exactly
///   its importers, not the whole corpus.
///
/// `default_export` itself needs no read-set entry: `scan_import_file`
/// resolves it by filtering `symbol_table.get(name)` down to entities in the
/// *same file*, so its value is a pure function of the file's own content —
/// the same self-invariant red-green section already
/// relies on for a file's own `entity_map`/`entity_ranges` reads.
///
/// # What is conservative
///
/// * **Only JS/TS files are ever cached or reuse-eligible for import-table
///   purposes**, matching every other red-green boundary in this crate.
///   Python/Rust/Go/Clojure imports are re-scanned and their entries
/// re-inserted on every build, exactly as before this change — slower, never
///   wrong.
/// * **A bare/package specifier default or namespace import
///   (`import x from 'lodash'`) forces its whole owning file's contribution
///   to be recomputed every build.** `find_import_file`'s fallback for a bare
///   specifier is a whole-corpus stem scan, not a bounded candidate list —
///   precisely tracking "would a new local file start matching this stem" is
/// possible but out of this change's budget; over-invalidating a file with
///   one is safe, just not free. Named imports/re-exports and relative
///   default/namespace imports (the common case for a repo's own cross-file
///   dependencies) are unaffected.
/// * **A RED, previously-cached file's named imports/re-exports are always
///   re-derived from `pending_named_local`/`pending_named_re_export`, never
///   from the stale cached `local_imports`/`re_export_imports` fields.** This
///   is exact for every import `scan_import_file`'s JS-specific regex loops
///   produce. The one theoretical gap: `scan_import_file` also runs a
///   generic Python-style `from X import Y` line scan unconditionally
///   (unrelated to `is_js_ts`), and a JS/TS file whose raw content happens to
///   contain a line matching that pattern (inside a string or comment, since
///   it cannot be valid JS/TS syntax) would have contributed an entry via
///   that path that is not captured in `pending_named_local`. A freshly
///   *re-scanned* file is unaffected (it uses `scan.local_imports`/
///   `re_export_imports` directly, exactly as the non-incremental function
///   does); only a file whose own content is unchanged but whose read set
///   was invalidated purely by another file's edit would miss such an entry.
///   Judged not worth the added complexity given how contrived the trigger
///   is; documented rather than silently accepted.
/// * **An add or a delete on a chunked (>20k-file) corpus still disables
