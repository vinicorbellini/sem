///

/// contributor to that contention -- a 92-second supervisor thread pinning
/// a core in *every* chunk it lands in, every build, deterministically
/// present regardless of outcome (it always exceeds budget; the doc comment
/// on [`PATHOLOGICAL_LINE_THRESHOLD`] has the measurement). This function

/// is expected to remove the specific +1-edge nondeterminism
/// measured (that borderline file's own solo parse time is nowhere near
/// 10s -- see `parse_time_probe`'s measurements
/// -- so its flip was contention-driven, not intrinsic).

/// classified without a clock: [`PATHOLOGICAL_LINE_THRESHOLD`]'s doc
