/// Bumped when any record shape or section meaning below changes. This is the

/// `facts_store::corpus_identity_salt()` in [`Header::build_salt`].
///
/// `2`: `REFS` targets are no longer bare entity indices — the
/// high `refs::KIND_BITS` bits now carry the edge's `ref_type` (`refs`
/// module below). The record *width* didn't change (still one `u32` per
/// posting), but the *meaning* of those bits did, which is exactly the class
/// of change `format_version` exists to guard: a `1`-tagged image
/// read under this code would have every target's top nibble misread as part
/// of the entity index, corrupting every `refs_of`/`callers_of` answer
/// silently. Bumping the version makes that a clean miss instead (`Header::
/// read` rejects any non-matching version outright, unconditionally, so no
/// migration path is needed — the next build just writes a `2`-tagged image).
///
/// `3`: `EntityRec` grows from 32 to 40 bytes — `start_byte`/
/// `end_byte` appended at offsets 32/36. Unlike `FLAG_ENTITY_TESTS`
/// (`is_test` precedent), there was no reserved padding left
/// to reuse: `EntityRec`'s 32 bytes were exactly full (the `_pad` `u16` that
/// precedent repurposed is `flags` now). A record whose *width* changes is
/// exactly `format_version`'s axis, not a flag's — every offset past
/// `ENTITIES`'s start shifts, so a `2`-tagged image read under `ENTITY_REC_
/// LEN = 40` would misalign every record after the first. Bumping makes that
/// a clean miss (magic/version/salt mismatch ⇒ "index does not exist")
/// instead of silent corruption. Cost, measured on the monster's 454,528-row
/// `ENTITIES` section: 32B → 40B is +8B/entity, +3.64 MB (14.5 MB → 18.2 MB),

///   extra bytes, zero extra reads — `kind_of`/`target_of` are a mask and a
///   shift on the word `csr_row` already loads. The cost is capping the

///   full 32, i.e. `MAX_ENTITIES` (268,435,456) entities per repo.

/// variants today and this field reserves 4 bits (16 values), 5x headroom for
